Concentration is focus. Itâ€™s also the amount of solute in a solution. The more solvent, the more dilute. Molarity is one way of measuring concentration. It is moles solution over litre solution ($C=\frac{n}{V}$). There is also $\frac{\%V}{V}$, the percentage of the total solution, as well as $\frac{\%W}{W}$. Finally there is also ppm for very small values.
