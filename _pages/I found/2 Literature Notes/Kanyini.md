# Kanyini

- Everyone just wants to at home.
	- We demolished the oldest home.
- Aboriginal Australians knew their home well, and took care of it.
	- You don’t defile your home.
- Everything is connected; everything is family.
- What’s there is there because it works.
- Not bound to anything material, or anything abstract.
- Kanyini (connection) was broken
	- Forced out of ngura (land); walytja (family) is split (animals and stuff)

> [!QUOTE] Better to do a source at one go

- Undermining of Aboriginal society
	- Ngura taken → walytjia (environment) split → walytjia (family) killed → tjukurrpa (customs) lost.
	- % 1910 to 1970, around 50,000 Aboriginal kids “stolen”
- Kurunpa broken by Christianity
	- Hypocrisy moment

- @ Ngura should not be understood as someone’s home, but rather as the land that they live in.
- They couldn’t be integrated into our system, but also cannot go back to their original state.
	- They are stuck in a valley
- What Aboriginal society needs is help to be able to understand the system that they are in.
	- Also need help reinstating Kanyini.
