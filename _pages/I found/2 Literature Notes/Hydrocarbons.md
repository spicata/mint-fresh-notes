# Hydrocarbon

- Functional groups decide chemical properties, homologous series decide physical
- Functional groups are added atoms, homologous series are hydrochains.
- Saturated with C-C

- Alkanes only have single bonds. Can be straight, branched, or ringular.
	- Are saturated, thus weak. Alkenes are more volatile because Van der Waals. Alkynes are just good I guess.
