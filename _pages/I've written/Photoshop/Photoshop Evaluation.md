# Photoshop Evaluation

I believe that I did well during this course. Across the few weeks, I:

- Tuesday, Week 1: Made “Cheetos” (following an online resource) and experimented with adjustment layers
- Thursday, Week 1: Found an online course and followed it, making considerable progress (Untitled-1). Found how to use adjustment layers properly, use clipping masks, resize and crop images. (**I lost this progress**)
- Monday, Week 2: Continued to follow the tutorial, discovering test, and hue sliders.
- Tuesday, Week 2: Start work on Digital graphic. Applied different adjustment layers and made a rip texture. Started work outlining the surroundings and adding colours
- Thursday, Week 2: Did lots of work on Digital graphic, the illustration half is near completion.
- Tuesday, Week 3: Finished the Digital graphic. Yay :)

For my final digital graphic, I used many different tools, such as the warp tool, adjustment layers, and the tablet for illustrations. I believe that the rip and the illustration section of the graphic were the stronger suits, and that the real side was rather plain, although some people disagreed with my evaluation. I would’ve liked to have stumbled across one of the tutorials I used a lot, as I may have been able to learn more that way. Also, in hindsight, it might have been nice to seperate the colours between the sky and the water, and also add some clouds in the sky. Apart from that, I am happy with my image. Attached below is the original image and the digital graphic:
