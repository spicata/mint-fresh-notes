Ideal Gas law assumes that gas is essentially truly random. Each gas molecule is a point (singularity), there are no intermolecular forces between gas particles, there is a great distance between particles, and they don’t lose energy when colliding. While this is true for gases at a certain temperature and pressure, most of them time, gases don’t act like that. It does help with [[Boyle n Charles]]’ law though.
