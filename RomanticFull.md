Romanticism is a reaction against neoclassicism. It’s emotional, irrational, childish, and it fights against the adult world. It does not break structure, but it’s willing to change the rules when it needs. It often focuses on emotion, nature, magical and other exotic aspects, a nostalgia for the past, and the admiration of beauty.

The Romantic Context 2 shaped the way that romanticism was formed. Romanticism was a reaction of the (then) modern world. A rebellion. The turned everything on its head. The unnaturalness of the industrial age gave rise to the emphasis on the beauty of nature. The pure reasoning of the Enlightenment (Romanticism) era gave rise to the love of human emotion and sensuality. Science gave rise to supernatural elements and ruins. Romanticism was to be the people's literature, not the elite's.

This was only emboldened by the French revolution. The ideas of liberty, equality, and fraternity rang true for romantics. They agreed.

The Birth of Romanticism happened during when Europe was industrialising and urbanising. Romantic poets was deeply regretful of this evolution of humanity, and preferred the rural, nature-filled existence. After all, things become more valuable the less we have of it. This was the case with nature.

Gothic literature was also developing during this era, and both movements benefited from each other. They share several similar themes, such as the emphasis of the supernatural and the sublime, as well as the study of ruins.

Romanticism happens during the 1700s through to the 1800s. During this time, neoclassicism and industrialisation were king. Neoclassicism emphasised the importance of human reason and logic. They were pure rationalists. This, combined with industrialisation, allowed science to spread around Europe.

Industrialisation also pushed everyone towards the city, and the urban environment was increasingly hostile to nature. Rural towns were less in favour.

The French Revolution also happened during 1789, which was the end of the French monarchy and the start of democracy. It's influences were felt around Europe. Liberty, equality, and fraternity suddenly became very important.

Romanticism was the reaction against classicism. This is a very common definition. It is also a very vague definition, which leads to the Problem with Romanticism.

Some other ways that people saw was that Romanticism is the literature of the living, whilst the classicism was for the dead, or that romanticism was about chivalry.

The word Romanticism is uh... pretty vague. It's use started in Germany, and then spread the France, England, Italy, Spain, the Slavic states. As it spread, it was used in Romanticism vs Classicism. With this, it became extremely vague. What does it mean to be Romantic? This is a common complaint.

Romanticism was the "people's" literature[1]. It was qoq informal (for the time), not filled with jargon, and understandable. Romantic authors enjoyed nature greatly, especially what they called the "sublime". They also believed in human emotion and intuition over pure reasoning. After all, writing is art. They also had trust in the power of human imagination. And also came back to mythological stories.

French Romanticism was a little rough. Firstly, we had the Problem with Romanticism, which was even more defined in France. Some French Romanticists were Noider, Vigny, and Hugo.

English Romanticism was pretty big. It started with the Lake Poets: Wordsworth, Coleridge, and Southey. They are called this because they lived near a lake (i presume). They were pretty big. Then we had the Scott Group, with... Scott. It also had (Thomas) Campbell and (Thomas) Moore. Finally, we had the Younger Group, with all of the late-romantic poets, such as Byron, Shelly, and Keats. They would suffer a bit more than the other ones.

The enlightenment was an age of reason and science, as well as knowledge and the pursuit of ideals. Thing such as the perfect world order, the perfect government, separation of the church and government. They were a smart bunch. Their pursuit of ideals were widely popular. In France, the emboldened population eventually brought down Ancien Regime.

Romanticism happened mainly in Germany, France, and England. It is seen as a reaction to neoclassicism (itself being the revival of classicism from Greece and Rome). The Problem with Romanticism is that it is kind of hard to define.

In England, Wordsworth and Coleridge are seen as the innovators of English Romanticism. They are responsible for the common Qualities of Romanticism.

Gothic literature is sometimes seen as a sort of precursor to romanticism.
