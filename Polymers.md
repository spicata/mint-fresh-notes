Don’t you love Lego? Using a few of the same bricks, you can end up creating some wacky patterns. Yeah, that’s essentially what a polymer is. A material made up of repeated units[^1] (see also: [[Materials]]). Nylon is a synthetic polymer, and so is plastic. Cellulose, which makes up cotton and paper is a natural polymer.

[^1]: This is called a monomer. Monomers plus monomers are polymers.
