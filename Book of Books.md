    - Finish homework

## 05th of February, 2023

- Finished homework: [[2023Feb02 Literature Homework]]

## 06th of February, 2023

- We shared romanticism notes.
- Movements are an indication in the shift of attitude of the public. Most reactions come about from "status quo >:-("
- We analysed *[[London]]*

## 07th of February, 2023

- What is London about?
- Literature is all about readings. These are your own interpretations.
- Topic sentences should be topic-led.
    - How about instead of the TEEL structure, we use the PETAL structure (point, evidence, techniques, analysis, link).
- We wrote a short reading on London. And... uh... honestly I think I did pretty terrible. It was hot garbage. I don't have high expectations :-/.
- We also looked at Daffodils.
- Here are some poetic devices:
    - Enjambment, when we don't finish a line in a poem with a full stop. 
    - Caesura, when we break a line in the middle with a break (- or : or .)
- Enjambment and caesura can work together for even more emphasis.
- Romanticism is also kind of about exploration of self.

## 8th of February, 2023

- We read *[[Daffodils]]*.
- To analyse texts, you need: 
    - your own interpretation
    - to figure out who is the persona
    - find the tone, as it shows emotions which reveals the author's values and attitude, and establishes mood.
- The title of a poem plays a significant part in the meaning of the poem.
- Coney jumped
- Zoomorphism is giving animal qualities to humans. Anthropomorphism is giving human qualities to animals.
- The structure found in *Daffodils* is a simplified version of the Shakespearean sonnet. It sounds cool, but is also accessible. Nice.
- Coney jumped

## 9th of February, 2023

- We continued doing *[[Daffodils]]*.
- We made teams for the oral presentation.
    - Hm. Edward's insulting me in Literature in the lead up to the oral presentation. This is either because:
        - He is not a nice guy, but I doubt this is true,
        - He is aggravating me so that I study harder for Literature. It worked.

## 13th of February, 2023

- Literally just panel discussing.

## 14th of February, 2023

- More panel discusisng

## 15th of February, 2023

- Homework: 
- Romantics didn't like "truths". How do we know they are real?
- We aren't made to fit into an artificial system.
- Society is artifice, we aren't real with ourselves.
- Children are untainted by society.
- We are all impacted by [[Romanticism]].
