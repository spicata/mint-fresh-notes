We can draw covalent bonds using the Lewis dot diagram as well as the line-bond structure. You’ve seen it before, in [[Covalent Bonding]], where I drew the funny dots and lines to show how the atoms were linked.

What the Lewis dot diagram does is is shows all the valence electrons, and shows how the atoms share pairs of electrons, as is the case in the $H_{2}O$ above. The hydrogen atoms share one electron with the oxygen, and vice versa, allowing all three atoms to have a fully filled shell.

We can depict the same with line-bond structure.

Note however that the Lewis dot diagram and line-bond structure don’t actually show what the molecule looks like in 3D. For example, water actually has an angle of 104.5 degrees.
