Schrodinger used probability measures for shells (see also [[Schrodinger Shell Model]]). This eventually culminated in orbitals and subshells. Orbitals are a way of predicting where an electron may be within an electron cloud[^1]. There are 4 kinds, s orbitals, p, d, and f. Here is my crappy rendition:

You should probably search it up. Anyways, orbitals are a subshell. There are many orbitals in one shell.

| Shell | Orbitals |
| --- | --- |
| K | (one) 1s |
| L | (one) 2s (three) 2p |
| M | (one) 3s (three) 3p (five) 3d |
| N | (one) 4s (three) 4p (five) 4d (seven) 4f |

Going back to the magnesium example (see [[Shell Model]]), the orbitals would be: $1s^{2}2s^{2}2p^{6}3s^{2}$.

[^1]: As many as two electrons can be in one orbital.
