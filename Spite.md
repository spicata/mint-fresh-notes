Half the things I do is out of spite.

I make a website to share information out of spite of paywalled information, tutors, and people who don't share their notes. If they won't provide free access to information, I will. Frick them. The spread of information will quite literally benefit everyone. Information requires negligible resources to spread. It's the `ctrl+c` and `ctrl+v` of the past. 

Adding to that, I write informally (but hopefully understandably enough) to spite the people who think they are better because they speak more fancy. I hate you guys. We are all just human, and we all have mistakes. Don't act like you are better than us.

I chose the harder subjects (that I did badly in) because, well first of all, I want to learn how to get better, but also out of spite of the school. If they won't teach people who will put in work and try to understand but struggle, what right do they have to teach at all? You can't cherry pick the best and only teach them. That's no fun.

I want to have fun just to spite the world of "productivity". So what if my overall output goes down? Is the purpose of being human truly to work for some corporate entity that is impersonal, unconnected, and unknown to me? I'd disagree. If they won't spent down of their throne to get to learn us, screw them. I want to work for humans, not for abstract terms.

I try to become the best version of me to spite past me. Goddammit I hate that guy. I'll work harder, and harder yet, just to outdo past me. I still hate that guy so much. No matter what version of me you meet, from the past, from the present, or from the future, we'll agree on one thing. The previous version were bad, and I hate them.

I stay live to spite death. Theoretically speaking, dying would allow us to get to the state of lowest energy the fastest, but that makes death's job too easy. That's no fun. He gets to suffer as I persist. I'll make him wait just a tad longer. You should too. Maybe one day, we'll make his job infinitely long.

I'm gonna stay happy just to not pay therapists. I don't know why I'm not gonna pay them, I just decided that way. (I'm sure if they got into therapy to make people not sad, they'll be happy, and if they got in for the money, what the hell your job is literally helping people and you are there for the money? Sure, everyone should, you know, probably be allowed to live comfortably, but if it boils down to only money, bruh.)
