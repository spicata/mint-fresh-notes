There are two things we use to get stuff done. A goal and a system. The goal is where you want to be. The system (such as [[Habits]]) is your way of getting there. Longing to achieve the goal doesn’t get you any closer to it. Instead, simply taking the system in the general direction of a goal, and enjoying you ride along the way will get you there faster then you’ll even imagine. **And** maybe along the way, you’ll find that it isn’t quite what it seems, and set a better goal way out in the horizon. Who knows.
