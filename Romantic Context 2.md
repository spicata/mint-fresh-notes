Romanticism happens during the 1700s through to the 1800s. During this time, neoclassicism and industrialisation were king. Neoclassicism emphasised the importance of human reason and logic. They were pure rationalists. This, combined with industrialisation, allowed science to spread around Europe. 

Industrialisation also pushed everyone towards the city, and the urban environment was increasingly hostile to nature. Rural towns were less in favour.

The French Revolution also happened during 1789, which was the end of the French monarchy and the start of democracy. It's influences were felt around Europe. Liberty, equality, and fraternity suddenly became very important.
