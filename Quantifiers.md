Quantifiers tell us if a value exists, and if so, how many values like that exist? Or specifically, a "there exists" ($\exists$) this value, and this condition applies "for all" ($\forall$) of these values. These symbols are informal.

"For all" means that this condition is true for all values. "There exists" means that there is at least one value that meets this condition.
