electrons are able to absorb specific wavelengths of light to jump up to higher energy levels. hence, when we shine a light of the same wavelength through an atomised sample, some of that light will be absorbed by the sample, so not all of it will pass through, meaning that a observer on the other side will not detect the absorbed wavelengths (obviously). if we plot this on a spectrum, we are able to create something called the "absorption spectrum". i will attach a diagram. this shows the complete spectrum, except that there are gaps where a wavelength is absorbed.

actually, search it up, i don't want to get dmca'd.

all elements have a different absorption spectrum, because their energy levels are also all different (due to the different nuclear charge and the shielding effect and other things). so, as like... lithium has looser energy levels, and hence the gaps between the are also larger, and hence the electrons need a higher energy input (which is the same as having a smaller wavelength), whilst neon, which has a higher nuclear energy has tighter shells and hence the electrons need a relatively low energy input to jump up to a higher energy. to add that, different atoms have different number of electrons, and different numbers of shells, and hence some atoms may have more spectral vars while others have less.

at a later point of time, the electrons that have been excited ("promoted" from a lower energy level to a higher energy level) will eventually fall back down to it's ground state, which is the state at which the electron has it's lowest energy. it does this by emitting a light wave with the same wavelength as the one it absorbed. the observer (such as us) can then measure this wavelength. if we continue to measure this wavelength and once again plot it onto a spectrum, we get what is called an emission spectrum. the emission spectrum is an empty spectrum that only has spectral bars where measured wavelengths of light are. if we add together the emission spectrum and the absoprtion spectrum, we get a continuous, complete spectram.

## atomic emission spectroscopy

we can identify the element found within a sample by analysing the wavelengths of emitted light. if we excite the electrons, we can record the light that is emitted as they fall down to its ground state. an example of aes is the flame test, which uses a qualitative (non-numeric) analysis of the colour of the flame of certain metal salts to determine which metal was present in the sample. for example, a potassium flame is violet.

## atomic absorption spectroscopy

we can also identify a sample based on by analysing the wavelengths that *are not absorbed*, and by extension the wavelengths of light that are absorbed. this is what is known as aas. we are able to run quantitative experiments using a machine known as an absorption spectrometer to indentify an element and the quantity of that element within a sample. firstly, the element is determined using qualitative means, and then a cathode lamp coated in that element is produced. this is in order to produce the exact wavelengths of light absorbed by that element, as the specialised cathode lamp will only re-emit those wavelengths of light. then, the light is shone through an the vaporised sample. the sample is turned into a vapour in order to atomise the sample, as this allows the sample to better absorb the light. some of the light is then absorbed by that sample. the rest that is not absorbed then passes through the sample and is ...

by doing this, we are able to determine the element.
