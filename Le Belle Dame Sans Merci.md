Set during the [[Medieval Age (Romanticism)]] and embeds supernatural elements. Examples include:

- "knight-at-arms"
- "faery’s child"
- "her Elfin grot"

It also heavily uses nature as the environment ("sedge has withered from the lake")[^1] as well as a stand-in for human emotion ("fever-dew", "cheeks a fading rose"). Human emotion is itself a defining [[Quality of Romanticism]], and this is also explored in this poem in the form of the love between the knight and the lady. 

I thought that you could liken this poem to how industrialisation seems promising at first, but is actually a bait, and leads to the degradation of the environment, and once you've been in an urban landscape, you'll struggle being in a rural one. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

[^1]: This specifically links to the general mood of the poem.
