Entropy is a measure of chaos in our universe. Which was strange to learn. I had always considered it to be maximal order. But oh well.

The right side, pure gas, is entropy heavy. The left side, an ice-cube, is entrophree ðŸ˜‰. Order means things don't happen. Disorder means things happen. Solids are orderly, gases are disorderly. Heat makes things more disorderly, because they move faster.
