> “Pressure or volume; choose one, not both.” - Boyle’s law, written by me.

When you have a steady temperature, you are only able to have high pressure and low volume, or high volume and low pressure (or anything in between) (see also [[What is Pressure?]]). Charles’ law is related heavily to Boyle’s law. When something is at a constant pressure, a higher temperature means a higher volume. The opposite is true too.
