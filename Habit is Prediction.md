We get our dopamine during craving, not reward[^1]. It’s because we can predict that good things[^2] ahead of us, and we get excited in anticipation. When the reward comes, our brains say: “Oh, I was already expecting this. No dopamine hit.”

[^2]: Good things for our monkey brain. Things like eating, reproducing, and other primitive stuff. We know beyond that, except our brains are still wired this way.
