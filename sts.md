This means "so to say". Except the actual phrase is "so to speak". The acronym holds, but I'm guilty for making lots of eggcorns.

Anyways, so to speak would typically be used to highlight that this is not the actual way someone would say it, but I'll use it to highlight that my vocabulary is very tiny and so it is probably not the right word, or to soften [[sts]] the word.
