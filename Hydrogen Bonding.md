Fluorine, oxygen, and nitrogen are all very stingy with their electrons; they don’t like sharing. So when they do begrudgingly share, they try to keep it on their own side. Little ol’ hydrogen sadly doesn’t have the strength to keep his electron close to him. So hydrogen becomes positively charged, whilst his friends becomes negatively charged. But due to this different in charge, his friends get stuck to hydrogen, creating the hydrogen bond, the strongest of the three bonds. Talk about getting the final laugh.
