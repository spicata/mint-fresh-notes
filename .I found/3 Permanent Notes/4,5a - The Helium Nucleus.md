# 4,5a - The Helium Nucleus
Alpha decay is the most common form of cluster decay, a type of decay where a nucleus splits into two or more smaller clusters of neutrons and protons[^1]. Its frequency is a result of the special properties of the helium nucleus. The helium nucleus is extremely stable and has a incredibly high binding energy ([4,5b - Binding Energy and Mass Defect](4,5b%20-%20Binding%20Energy%20and%20Mass%20Defect.md)md)md))[^2].![Binding-Energy](../../../assets/Binding-Energy.png)ng)

On top of that, the protons and neutrons inherently form pseudo-helium nuclei inside of another nucleus[^3], and thus, when decaying, split off a helium nucleu[4 - Alpha Decay](4%20-%20Alpha%20Decay.md)ay.md)ay)

[^1]: What is the difference between fission and cluster decay?
[^2]: Why though? Is it to do with the geometry?
[^3]: Is this due to the stability of helium-4?
