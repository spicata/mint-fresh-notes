# 4,6a - Harms of Ionising Radiation
$\alpha$ decay, $\beta$ decay, and $\gamma$ decay are all forms of ionising radiation, and these can cause large amounts of damage to the human body, however, due o their properties, they all do a different amount of damage, differently, to they human body.

$\alpha$ decay is extremely ionising, however, it cannot penetrate most substances and cannot travel far; it does not prove much of a threat outside of the body. However, if it enters the body through cuts, digestion, or breathing, then it can wreck havoc inside your body.

$\beta$ decay is moderately ionising, and it does a better job and penetrating skin, which can cause (beta) burns. However, as with $\alpha$ decay, it is even more dangerous when inside your body.

$\gamma$ decay is only slightly ionising, however, it is dangerous due its ability to completely pierce the human body, as well as some layers of lead and concrete. Gamma decay can also travel relatively far compare to the others, and thus pose the largest threat in nuclear fallouts.

Ionising radiation is able to destroy the internal processes of a cell, which can lead to many illnesses, such as vomiting, nausea, and fatigue, as well as an increase in the probability of cancer in later life. If one is subject to a large dosage of radiation is a short time, they may develop **acute radiation syndrome**, which is a more dangerous form of radiation poisoning[^1].
