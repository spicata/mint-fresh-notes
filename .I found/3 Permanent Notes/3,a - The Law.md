# 3,a - The Law
The Law is a slippery topic to define, however, it is commonly accepted as the common norms and values that are accepted in Aboriginal communities[^1], and sometimes spanning many communities. Unlike the laws found in Western culture ([[3,b - Western Laws](3,b%20-%20Western%20Laws.md)), Aboriginal customary law is immutable/fixed to humans[^2], as it was not created by us, but rather the spiritual ancestors that formed the world ([[3 - Aboriginal Worldview, Society (P)](3%20-%20Aboriginal%20Worldview,%20Society%20(P).md)).

[^1]: What happens when one breaks these Laws?
[^2]: Does this imply that it does not change in interpretation every generation?
