# 14 - Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs

> [!Warning] Disclaimer about Maslowâ€™s Hierarchy
> Obviously, needs are not strictly hierarchical. Also, there is lack of evidence for self-actualisation, something that Maslow acknowledges as well.

Self-actualisation is the pinnacle of the hierarchy; the fulfilment of potential. Maslow posits it as the ultimate goal that everyone achieves, and it is different, yet clearly defined for everyone ([13a1b - Ends](13a1b%20-%20Ends.md)md)). This can be thought of as the **peak experiences** that people have. It also indicates a shift towards positivity in psychology.
