# 10 - Expressionism

Expressionism is a literary and artistic movement that originates in Germany around the period of World War 1; a direct opposition to materialism and realism. Ideas in expressionist literature are often conveyed through careful introspection of the characters, rather than coming about as a result of setting, and thus monologues and exaggerated and emphasised feelings are prevalent. It has been described as impactful and harsh. As for the ideas found within expressionist literature, it is often focused on internal turmoil and the systematic shortcomings of society. Franz Kafka has sometimes been cited as an expressionist writer.
