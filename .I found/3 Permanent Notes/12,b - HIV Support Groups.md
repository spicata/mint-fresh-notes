# 12,b - HIV Support Groups

There are various support groups that exist specifically for HIV, as it is such a pressing and important health issue that continues to plague us ([12,c - Talking about HIV](12,c%20-%20Talking%20about%20HIV.md)md)). In Australia, there are lots of non-government organisations that people with HIV can turn to for help, such as [NAPWHA](https://napwha.org.au/), [AFAO](https://www.afao.org.au/), and [WAAC](https://www.waac.com.au/). There exist further resources at [Youth Solutions](https://youthsolutions.com.au/support/hiv-hepatitis-and-sexual-health-services/) and [Health Direct](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/hiv-infection-and-aids#resources) (the latter also provides valuable information on HIV).

To add to that, those who believe they have HIV and are in a position where they could have gotten HIV are able to see their local hospital to get a check-up.
