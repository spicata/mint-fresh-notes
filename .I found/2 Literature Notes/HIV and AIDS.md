## (Wikipedia, 2022)

- HIV infects the human immune system (Helper T cells, macrophages)
	- Causes the immune system to turn on itself, allowing diseases. 

## (Wikipedia, 2022)

- Allows for opportunistic diseases, as well as the development of cancer cells
- Transmitted by bodily fluids; using drugs, sexual intercourse, more. 

## (simpleshow foundation, 2014)

- HIV opens up body for other pathogens 
- Testing and protection can protect 

## (HIV.gov, n.d.)

- HIV can be supressed so that it cannot be transmitted to other. (68% of people)
- Stigma is a great counter to current attempts to treat HIV.
- On top of that, there is no cure.

## (Mayo Clinic, n.d.)

- HIV is broken into 3 phases
	- Acute HIV
	- Clinical latency (Chronic)
	- Symptomatic HIV
- Acute HIV is the first symptoms of HIV
	- Usually so mild that people do not notice it
	- Similar to cold symptoms
		- Fever, headache, sore throat, diarrhea, weight loss, coughing
- Latency
	- HIV decides to sleep for a while.
	- No symptoms.
- Symptomatic HIV
	- More severe symptoms
		- Fever, swollen lymph nodes, pneumonia, shingles.
-  Finally develops into AIDS, where the immune system has been weaken to an extent that it can’t operate well
	- Chronic diarrhea, swollen lymph nodes, fatigue. Also more prone to getting sick.

## (Balzer, 2021)

- HIV can be supressed, not cured
	- Difficult to cure because of how HIV works. HIV embeds itself within the lymphatic system, particularly the lymph nodes. This is where is stays latent. Using meds, we can kill all the HIV in bloodstream, except they just return.
- Don’t get HIV.

## (HIV.gov, 2022)

- Antiretroviral therapy can be used to supress HIV.
- This allows for safe sex between a HIV pos and neg person given that the viral load is undetectable.
- AIDS and symptomatic are the same?
