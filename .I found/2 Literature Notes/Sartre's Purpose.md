# Sartreâ€™s Purpose

- Sartre is aethist
	- No god, and thus no creator
		- Played into the idea of no essence
- Anti-teleological
- Do you have a purpose?
	- People are able to make their own purpose
		- We have value, we are ends.
- More about freedom
	- We should break from habit
- I am responsible for what I am free for
	- This is the Kingdom of ends/Categorical imperative
