# Sartre

- World is a strange place, real through rationalisation
- If we look at the basics, the world is absurd
- We dictate our own nature, and there are countless possibilities. What do we do?
- “Bad faith” is when we take away our freedom
- Capitalism can take away this freedom. Sartre was very disliked by the government of the United States of America.
	- Often would go to protests
- Humans firstly exist, then find their purpose.
	- Also, God is dead
