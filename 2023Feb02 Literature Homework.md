## Re: Romanticism

[[Romanticism]] (see also [[Romanticism 2]]) was an artistic movement[^1] that was a reaction to the (then) modern world, which was filled with neoclassicism, [[Enlightenment (Romanticism)]], and industrialisation (see [[Romantic Context]] and [[Romantic Context 2]]). Romantics were critical of the state of their world, and so they rebelled against the common themes during art during that time. It happened during the 1700s through to the 1800s (see [[Birth of Romanticism]]).

Some notable romantic writers were Wordsworth, Coleridge, Byron, and Keats ([[English Romanticism]]). Some notable artists were Turner, Blake, Caspar Friedrich, and Delacroix.

Romanticism heavily focused on the beauty of nature, specifically the sublime, as a form of criticising the industrial and urban living environment. They also loved human emotion and senses, rather than the reason and science that was common due to neoclassicism and the Enlightenment ([[Romanticism 2]] and [[Quality of Romanticism]]).

Romantic art (as in visual art) focused on the grand and sublime natural environment, or on the power of humanity: it's emotions, imagination, individualism, etc. Romantic politics were focused on individualism and idealism, as well as the ideas of fraternity, liberty, and equality spread by the French revolution. This revolution had a particularly large impact on Romanticism, and its ideals were adopted by many romantics. As for romantic religion, romantics were Christians, were atheists, or was Blake. Blake is interesting to study, not only due to his works, but also for his unique flavour of religion.

## Re: Literature

As stated above: "Some notable romantic writers were Wordsworth, Coleridge, Byron, and Keats".

### Re: Lake Poets

The Lake Poets (see [[English Romanticism]]) were a group of poets that happened to all live in the Lake District of the UK. They were Wordsworth, Coleridge, and Southey. Wordsworth and Coleridge are famous for essentially kick-starting the English (literary) Romanticism movement as we know it. The were famous for their *Lyrical Ballads*.

Coleridge was a poet commonly known for writing the aforementioned work, but also *The Rime of the Ancient Mariner*, and *[[Kubla Khan]]*. Coleridge's poetry was characterised by the supernatural, which he worked with such mastery that he was able to make the unfamiliar seem familiar. He was also a master of the poetry text form, as some of his texts relied primarily on this expertise, appealing to aestheticism rather that on meaning.

As well as the *Lyrical Ballads*, Wordsworth was also known for a variety of other poems, such as *The Prelude*, *The Recluse*, and *Poems, in Two Volumes*. Wordsworth's poetry was known for its use of simple, everyday English (at the time), as well its characteristic Romantic qualities. Being one of the founders of the Romantic movement, these themes were unique in his time.

*[[London]]* (extract above) is a romantic poem by William Blake that highlights and criticises life in London.

*Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus* (extract below) is a romantic prose by Mary Shelly (written supposedly for a competition) that depicts Victor Frankenstein, a (mad) scientist, who brings a creature made of corpses to life.

> Why did I not die? More miserable than man ever was before, why did I not sink into forgetfulness and rest? Death snatches away many blooming children, the only hopes of their doting parents: how many brides and youthful lovers have been one day in the bloom of health and hope, and the next a prey for worms and the decay of the tomb! Of what materials was I made, that I could thus resist so many shocks, which, like the turning of the wheel, continually renewed the torture? But I was doomed to live.

## Re: Art

![[Liberty Leads.png]]

*Liberty Leading the People* by Delacroix (1830). It's considered romantic due its emphasis on liberty, inspired by the French revolution, as well as the strength of human individualism (see [[5eyes]]).

![[Sea of Fog.png]]

*Wanderer above a Sea of Fog* by Friedrich (1818). Its depiction of nature at its greatest, what romantics would call the "sublime", is characteristic of romanticism.
