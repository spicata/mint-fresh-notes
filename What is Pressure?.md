I realised that… I don’t actually know what pressure *is*. Like what does it measure? Length measures distance, mass measures the amount of “stuff”, volume measures the capacity. But what about pressure?

Well apparently, pressure is the amount of force over an area. It’s a derived quantity. Usually measured in pascals. So, I mean that’s cool, and now I know what pressure actually is.
