hypothesis: if the external force acting on the system increases, then the acceleration of the system increases proporitonally.

independent variable: the total mass of the slotted masses slotted in the mass hanged (g)

dependent variable: the accleration of the trolley (m s^-2)

controlled variables:
- the total mass of the system (g)
- the height of the table and by extension the length travelled by the car with a constant acceleration (m)

method:
1. set up the system by clamping a pulley on the end of the table. then attach the trolley and the mass hanger together with a rope of length \_\_\_. Then place the trolley on the table facing towards the pulley and the mass hanger over the side of the table with the rope over the pulley.
2. mark where on the table the start of the trolley is when the mass hanger is almost touching the pulley (mark A). then mark where the start of the trolley is when the mass hanger is almost touching the floor (mark B). this is the distance where the trolley will experience an acceleration. measure this distance
3. place six 50g masses on the trolley and none of the mass hanger, so that the total mass of the system is 950 g (600g[^1] + 300g[^2] + 50g[^3])
4. then place the start of the trolley at mark A.
5. let go gently, recording the time it takes for the trolley to reach mark B.
6. repeat steps 4 and 5 three more times.
7. move one of the masses from the trolley onto the mass hanger.
8. repeat steps 4, 5, 6, and 7 five more times.
9. calculate the acceleration using the motion equations.

note: if you are using the vernier motion logger, set the motion detector behind the trolley, and instead of recording the time, record the average acceleration that the trolley experiences.
