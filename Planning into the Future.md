Humans are dumb. What we cannot see **now** and cannot feel **now** essentially doesn’t exist for us. That’s why we are kind of crap at planning for the future. Future me is a distinct individual from me. That’s not true. Sometimes we just have to buckle down and suffer now so that we can prosper later.
