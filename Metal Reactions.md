Metals can react with water. It's either really fast or slow. It'll usually produce metal oxides and hydrogen. Sometimes, it'll produce metal hydroxides instead. 

It can also react with dilute acids, such as hydrochloric acid and sulphuric acid to produce hydrogen and a metal salt. Don't do it with nitric acid. It makes nitric oxide. Very bad for you (don't test it).

Some metals react with oxygen gas. The most reactive make peroxides, less reactive make oxides, some just get oxide films, and some metals are noble, like gold. It just doesn't want to react.
