Every single decision[^1] you encounter was made by a human. Other people. Because they make decision. LLCs, as powerful and influential they are (see [[Power of the LLC]]), can’t make decision. Of course an imaginary entity can’t. Only the people behind it can make these decisions. 

But again, we are only human. And humans make mistakes. Lots of mistakes. It’s only inevitable that we end up misunderstanding each other.
