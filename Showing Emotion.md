Emotions dictate how you will work. So then it is important that they know who you feel. Take time to share and show emotion, and when this is happening, don’t attack (sea also [[Acting in Fear]]), and if it seems that it’ll get out of hand, make sure only a few (or 1) people express their (strong) feelings at a time.
