Who was Keats? Well, he was a writer who burnt bright and short. He lived in the UK during the Industrial Revolution. He was the eldest son of his family. Their family was not rich, not poor, but then his dad died, and so his family went into debt. He could’ve become a surgeon, but instead became a writer. I’m sure he got flamed for that. He was Christian, and also described as “volatile”; full of emotion. He wrote for 6 years, then died 💀. Despite this, he had a great impact on literature. Cool guy.
