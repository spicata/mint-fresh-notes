When constructing a criticism of a text (remember, this is your interpretation), you could either go along the grain, or against the grain. The first one means that you follow what the majority consensus is. You bandwagon. The second one means: "Fair point, but I disagree". It is to come in conflict with the majority vote.

Do the first if you want to be safe but boring (jk). Do the second if you want to be bold but risky. Unless you actually agree with one of the interpretations. Then choose that.

Do keep in mind that [[Context Matters]], so look at history. Then you might know if you are with the grain or against it.
