## Reliability & Validity & Accuracy & Precision
- **Reliability** is when you can repeat an experiment and get the same results, which can be achieved by *repetition* and *replication*.
- **Validity** is the extent to which the tests measure what was intended, which can be achieved by using *control variables* and *control groups*.
---
- **Accuracy** is the degree of closeness of measurements of a quantity to its actual true value.
- **Precision** is the closeness of measurements to each other.
## Scientific Papers
Scientific papers come in the structure:
1. Title
2. Background Information
3. Aim
4. Hypothesis
5. Risk Assessment*
6. Materials and Method
7. Diagram
8. Results
9. Discussion
10. Conclusion

*Huh, ten steps. How convenient.*
### Aim
Show why you are doing a certain experiment. What is the goal? That's what your aim is. It can be written in the structure:
> What happens to [dependent variable] when we change [independent variable]? This is to determine...
### Hypothesis
The hypothesis is a **statement** predicting what will happen. It can be written in an "if, then" statement, such as:
> If [independent variable] [increases/decrease], then [dependent variable] [increases/decreases]

When writing a hypothesis, do not:
- Use "amount", instead opt to use the word: "number/concentration/mass/ecetera"; and
- Do not use "because", you do not need to explain.
### Materials and Methods
As for the materials, simply list all of them, however, still be specific. If you used a 500ml beaker, write "500ml beaker" instead of "beaker".

Method should be clear enough so that another person should be able to replicate your experiment. Use a numbered or bullet point list, and write in a passive past-tense voice. Do not say "I", science doesn't care about the "I".
### Graphing Rules
1. **Independent** variable → *x-axis* <br> **Dependent** variable → *y-axis*
2. Choose type of **graph**
3. Give your graph a **title** (effect of independent on dependent)
4. Determine **range**
5. **Label** each axis
6. Plot with **small dots**
7. Use sharp pencil and ruler
8. Use more than **half the space**
9. Use a **key**
### Results
You write your observations here. They can be qualitative or quantitate. Use tables here.

### Discussion
Describe trends and patterns in your results, and support it with evidence, and refer to your background information here.

You can also state the limitations of the study. Being disorganised is not a limitation of the study. It's a limitation of you. Not having resources is a limitation. Also propose a way to overcome these limitations.
### Conclusion
Were you right? Does your experiment support or disprove your hypothesis? Describe your findings, and refer to evidence.
