Your stance is often a good indication of what you are actually fighting for. However, if you stance becomes to crux of your argument, then it probably won’t end well (see [[Negotiating on Stances]] and [[Stances and Ego]]). You can think of you stance as a measure of what you want. But fight for what you want, not for the stance. It’s **only** a measure (see also [[Goodhart's Law]]).
