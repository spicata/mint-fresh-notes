The law of conservation of mass is a pretty important rule in my opinion. If something exists in a closed system, no inputs and no outputs, the total amount of “stuff” in that system stays the same. It’s pretty self evident. And so things like the reactants is made of the same thing as the products in equal amounts. The universe doesn’t actually get more stuff, just becomes more empty space. Things like that.

We can go further. You know Einstein’s famous equation? E equals MC squared? Yeah, well using that, we know that mass and energy are actually just the same thing. So it arises that, the total amount of energy must also stay the same. I think that’s pretty interesting. All we can do is work with what we already have.
