Currently thinking about: trains

Welcome! And if you've already been here, welcome back! 

This is where I published my finished, good notes. Not a lot, if at all, but I have hopes for the future.

- [Nuclear_Decay v2.pdf](assets/Nuclear_Decay%20v2.pdf)

Apart from that, I also make some other resources too. Such as flashcards. Take it if you need it:

- [Valency flashcards](assets/Chemistry%20Valency.apkg)

Also, here are my lesson journals. At this point, I've accepted that you probably already know who I am.

- [Chinese Journal](notes/Blessed Li.html)
- [Chem Journal](notes/Chem Case.html)
- [Physics Journal](notes/Chronicles of Waters.html)
- [Literature Journal](notes/Coney Story.html)
- [Methods Journal](notes/Gannon Exercises.html)
- [Spec Journal](notes/Pearce Dialogue.html)
