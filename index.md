Currently thinking about: trains

Welcome! And if you've already been here, welcome back! 

This is where I published my finished, good notes. Not a lot, if at all, but I have hopes for the future.

- [Nuclear_Decay v2.pdf](assets/Nuclear_Decay%20v2.pdf)

Apart from that, I also make some other resources too. Such as flashcards. Take it if you need it:

- [Valency flashcards](assets/Chemistry%20Valency.apkg)
