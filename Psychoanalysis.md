Psychoanalysis was psychology by Sigmund Freud. Somehow, it bled it's way into [[Literary Theory]] as well. A big topic in psychoanalysis is the idea of the unconscious, a little part of you that acts as your "warehouse of sad". Much like how you wouldn't want a nuclear waste facility to leak radioactive waste, you don't want this warehouse to leak. However, it's an imperfect warehouse made badly, and so it does leak.

Any past (very past, like childhood) trauma, even those which you don't remember, is stored in that small warehouse. Your past ends up influencing present action, repeatedly. That's why we erect [[Defences (Psychoanalysis)]]. This influences how you act.

A psychoanalyst's job is not to strengthen these defences, but it is to reduce in to rubble. Only then can they actually deal with the [[Core Issues]].
