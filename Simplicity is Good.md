I do not understand why people try to be so fancy. So lofty. If you are saying something, and people aren't understanding, clearly you are saying it wrongly. The point of language is not so that you can seem smart. That would be [[Missing the Point]]. It's to get an idea in my head into yours. Don't you agree?

I don't mean that you should be simple. Just saying that you shouldn't be convoluted. Elegance is something I like. If you can make a confusing statement into something most people can understand with few words, go ahead. Simplicity is something I like. When there is a more understandable term for something, use that term. You've got to increase the understanding per word rather than the word count or word length.
