isotopes are different atoms of the same element. the key difference is that it differs in the number of neutrons, and thus differs in some physical qualities, such as mass and density. for example, carbon has 3 isotopes, c-12, c-13, and c-14. c-12 is by far the most the most abundant isotope of carbon. c-13 is also quite common in nature. there are trace amounts of c-14 in nature, but this isotope is unstable, and it beta decay into other atoms.
