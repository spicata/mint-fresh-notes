Protons, neutrons, and electrons are all (very important) subatomic particles, which together compose an atom. Protons and neutrons[^1] form the nucleus, whereas electrons orbit around said nucleus.

The proton has an atomic mass of 1.00759u and are positively charged. and neutrons have a mass of 1.00848u and they do not have a charge. Electrons have an indiscernible mass, and a negative charge[^2] (see also: [[Relative Atomic Mass]]).

[^1]: Together known as nucleons
[^2]: Okay fine, it has a mass of 0.00055u. But that literally contributes almost nothing. Youâ€™re gonna need over 1800 electrons to come close to equalling a proton in mass, and they are all just going to repel each other.
