Romanticism is a reaction against neoclassicism. It’s emotional, irrational, childish, and it fights against the adult world. It does not break structure, but it’s willing to change the rules when it needs. It often focuses on emotion, nature, magical and other exotic aspects, a nostalgia for the past, and the admiration of beauty.
