# About me

I am a(n)… who studies a variety of subject. I make these notes along a group of friends. The most active (and closest) of these website is [Ed's Obsidian Notes (eddietheed.github.io)](https://eddietheed.github.io/obsidiannotes-v.2/), however, there are more notes at:

- [notes™️ (notmario.net)](https://notes.notmario.net/)
- [Mace's Notes (macesnotes.netlify.app)](https://macesnotes.netlify.app/)
