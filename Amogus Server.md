## Proposal 1 Re: inactive members

We should kick inactive members of the amogus server, as they don't contribute much or in just lurking (uncool if you do it for extended periods of time). Initially, we should just kick them but allow them back in if they ask. However, if someone already kicked for inactivity rejoins and goes inactive again, they should be kicked permanently/long time.

The inactive members that should be kicked are:

- Tony
- Gary
- Santi
- Taj

They have less than 50 messages combined.

The other members that I say we should consider inactive and consider kicking are:

- Fred:
    He messages every once in a while, and occasionally the content is not good. Also, he rarely responds to pings, and it is easier to contact him through DMs.
- Mace:

- Gnanadeep: barely active
- Kai Jun: ditto
- Callum: ditto
- Woon: Last time talked was New Years, and before that was exams.
