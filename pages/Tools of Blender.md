# Tools of Blender

Blender is a amazingly useful application, however, it owes its success to the various tools that can be found on it, which range from simple scales to complex physics animation tools, however, they all require at least some understanding to use these tools. These are the tools that you need to be familiar with in Blender.

## Move

In Blender, the **move tool** is one of, if not the most useful tools. It is pretty self explanatory, it is used to move objects. It can be accessed by pressing `G`, which will allow you to start moving the object.

From there, you can press `X` to only move it on the x-axis, `Y` to only on the y-axis, and `Z` for the z-axis. Alternatively, you can also do `Shift+X` to move on both the y and z-axes, `Shift+Y` for x and z-axes, and `Shift+Z` for x and y-axes.

## Scale

The **scale tool** is used to change the scale of an object, such as stretching or shrinking. It is accessed by pressing `S`, which will allow it to start scaling your object. At first it will scale in all 3 dimensions, enlarging or shrinking.

To scale it on only certain axes, you simply have to press `X`, `Y`, `Z`, `Shift+X`, `Shift+Y`, or `Shift+Z` similarly to the move tool

## Zooming, Panning, and Rotating

These are three different tools, however, these are essential to moving around the view in the editor.

You scroll on the `MB2` (also known as middle mouse button or `MMB`) to zoom in and to zoom out. This will make the viewing camera to come closer or further in reference to the focal point. To rotate the camera view, hold `MB2` and drag around in the view, which rotates you around the focal point. To pan, hold `Shift+MB2` and drag to pan around.

## Numpad Shortcuts

The numpad is an extremely useful tool in Blender, as it contains many camera controls that streamlines creation. 

### `NumPad 1`,  `NumPad 3`,  `NumPad 7`,  `NumPad 9`

These four keys align the view camera to certain angles based on the 3D-cartesian plane, and switches the type of projection to orthographic. This is used to get a right-on (`NumPad 3`), front-on (`NumPad 1`), or top-on (`NumPad 7`), view of the project, which is especially useful when only manipulating objects in certain axes or when editing an object. 

`NumPad 9` is reserved for flipping your view. For example, if you have front-on view from `NumPad 3`, then pressing `NumPad 9` would back it a back-on view.

### `NumPad 2`,  `NumPad 4`,  `NumPad 6`,  `NumPad 8`

These four keys move the view camera around the focal point by constant increment. `NumPad 2` and `NumPad 8` rotates the camera in an downwardly or upwardly direction respectively. On the other hand, `NumPad 4` and `NumPad 6` rotates the camera towards the left or right direction.

### `NumPad 5` and `NumPad .`

`NumPad 5` changes the view from perspective to orthographic and vice versa, whilst `NumPad .` changes the focal point to the selected object. These two are extremely useful when navigating the view, especially `NumPad .`as it allows to easily move around in the view.

## Edit Mode

Edit mode is the mode that one has to enter to change an object in the scene. To enter edit mode, press `Tab`, which will create large dots on the vertices of the selected object and will have more tools on the left sidebar. From here, you can use many more tools such asâ€¦

## Extrusion

Extrusion is an edit-mode tool, meaning that it can only be accessed in edit mode. This tool extrudes a face, edge, or vertex. To use extrusion in edit mode, press `E` after selecting one of the earlier shapes. This will create an extension that you can move around similar to the grab tool. If confirmed, the object will be placed there.

## Modifiers

Modifiers are qualities that you can add to an object to make them different. Two notable modifiers are the subdivision surface modifiers and the array modifier. The subdivision surface modifier separates the surface into many smaller surfaces, which can make something look more smooth but also can cause an object to be more rounded. The array modifier duplicates an object along the axes, which allows you to make walls and other things.

These modifiers can be found in the right side-menu, on the wrench icon.

## Materials

Materials are textures that you can apply to objects to make them look different. They can be found on the right side-menu, on the patterned circle icon. Using textures, we can make the floor look like grass, make solids metallic, and make liquids transparent.
