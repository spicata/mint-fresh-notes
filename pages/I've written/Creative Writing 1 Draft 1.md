EvyerhtEing coming to c close. My vision is growing dim, the world around mes shricks, slowly, slowly. The darkness creps into the room, consuming the chiars, the tables. The lamp flickers, fihgtign the void, futile. The screams and crying of the past only ring as echoes, muffled, soon there will only be silence. The   silence of the end. Left drifitn in space, nothing left to explore. Nothing to see, nothing to hear. But alive, barely. Conscious of the newly found   silent melody. 

Only me and my thouhgts now. if there only was more time... and less time. Death waits patientyl, teasing me, leaving me to suffer. My thoughts, my only companion - my light in the dark - slowly slips to the hands of time. Soon, it will be just me. Is this how it ends?

Will it really  just be me, waiting. As my mentaal faculties degrade, as everything fades. My memories, my thoughs, my sneses, my life. I sigh. What use is it to struggle. Drifitng in time and space, and empyt nothingness except for the two bright star that looms out of reach. One Glowing orange and yellow, flickering and shimmering, flames dancing on it. Full of life and energy. Th other, glowing a blinding white, yet seems not tos hine, rather it remains constant and unmoving in the sky. And there is me, caught between the two.

Just watiing. Just waiting. Just waiting. Just waiting. Just waiting.

 I close my eyes, just waiting. Finding peace at the end. Where it is, I don;t know. Unaware, as the sky turn orange, the bright, warm rays on my skin. Sounds suddenly clear, eyes now anew. Everything I've experienced , everything felt rushing back, as I fall into the comfortability of the past. My eyes remain closed. Soon the warmth falls away into the coolness of the white-blue light.
