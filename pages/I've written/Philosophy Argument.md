# Philosophy Argument

> [!TODO] Aboriginal Dreaming stories focus on the virtue of treating nature as beings with an end, and the vice of treating them as a means ([13 - Kantian](../I%20know/3%20Permanent%20Notes/13%20-%20Kantian), [15 - Virtue Ethics](../I%20know/3%20Permanent%20Notes/15%20-%20Virtue%20Ethics)). 
> - Kanyini schema as an Aboriginal moral point of view [Kanyini](../I%20know/2%20Literature%20Notes/Kanyini)
> - Maslow’s Hierarchy as a theoretical model of human nature and human motivation ([Maslow's Hierarchy](../I%20know/2%20Literature%20Notes/Maslow's%20Hierarchy), [Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs 2](../I%20know/2%20Literature%20Notes/Maslow's%20Hierarchy%20of%20Needs%202), [14 - Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs](../I%20know/3%20Permanent%20Notes/14%20-%20Maslow's%20Hierarchy%20of%20Needs))
> - The theory of at least one philosopher we have looked at ([Epicurus (L)](../I%20know/2%20Literature%20Notes/Epicurus%20(L)), [Sartre](../I%20know/2%20Literature%20Notes/Sartre), [13 - Kantian](../I%20know/3%20Permanent%20Notes/13%20-%20Kantian))

## What I need to research:

- Maslow’s hierarchy of needs,
- Sartre’s philosophy,
- Kanyini schema, and
- how to write philosophical arguments.
