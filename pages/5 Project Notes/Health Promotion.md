# Health Promotion

A good health promotion (about HIV) should focus on not only informing the public about a certain health concern, but also providing additional resources, how to approach the issue, and ways to mitigate the transmission. This is what I intend to do for my HIV health promotion. I would like to:
1. Inform the public on the impact of STIs, especially HIV;
2. How HIV works, as understanding something allows people to do something about it;
3. Prevention and treatment;
4. How to approach and talk about HIV; and
5. Provide external resources.

This would be done to raise awareness about HIV and aid those who currently have it, as well as informing teens about how to prevent the spread of HIV.

## Key Message

The key message for this campaign would be to *learn more*, as I believe that learning about a certain topic will:
1. Spur people to take action; 
2. Lessen the stigma about HIV; and
3. Allow people to understand how HIV works.
