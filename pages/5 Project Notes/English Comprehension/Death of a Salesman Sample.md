> [!Question] Explain how an author's manipulation of language devices has informed your understanding of one or more texts you have studied.

Within Literature, authors utilise literary techniques to position readers to espouse certain ideas put forward. This is exemplified in *The Death of a Salesman* by Arthur Miller, an American Tragedy set in post-Great-Depression Boston, depicting a Willy Loman, with the titular occupation, struggle as his world begins to fall apart. Miller represents the betrayal of the individuals by the American Dream, the separation of the Loman family, and the insanity that exacerbated this, in order to show the detrimental impact that American culture and society has on its individuals, and the people around them.
