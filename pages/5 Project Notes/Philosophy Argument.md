# Philosophy Argument

> [!TODO] Aboriginal Dreaming stories focus on the virtue of treating nature as beings with an end, and the vice of treating them as a means ([13 - Kantian](../3%20Permanent%20Notes/13%20-%20Kantian)). 
> - Kanyini schema as an Aboriginal moral point of view [Kanyini](../2%20Literature%20Notes/Kanyini)
> - Maslow’s Hierarchy as a theoretical model of human nature and human motivation [Maslow's Hierarchy](../2%20Literature%20Notes/Maslow's%20Hierarchy), [Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs 2](../2%20Literature%20Notes/Maslow's%20Hierarchy%20of%20Needs%202.md), [14 - Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs](../14%20-%20Maslow's%20Hierarchy%20of%20Needs.md)
> - The theory of at least one philosopher we have looked at [Epicurus (L)](../2%20Literature%20Notes/Epicurus%20(L)), [Sartre](../2%20Literature%20Notes/Sartre)

## What I need to research:

- Maslow’s hierarchy of needs,
- Sartre’s philosophy,
- Kanyini schema, and
- how to write philosophical arguments.
