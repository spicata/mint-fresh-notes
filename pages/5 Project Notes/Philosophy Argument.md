# Philosophy Argument

> [!TODO] Aboriginal Dreaming stories focus on the virtue of treating nature as beings with an end, and the vice of treating them as a means. 
> - Kanyini schema as an Aboriginal moral point of view [Kanyini](../2%20Literature%20Notes/Kanyini.md)
> - Maslow’s Hierarchy as a theoretical model of human nature and human motivation [Maslow's Hierarchy](../2%20Literature%20Notes/Maslow's%20Hierarchy.md)
> - The theory of at least one philosopher we have looked at [Epicurus (L)](../2%20Literature%20Notes/Epicurus%20(L).md), [Sartre](../2%20Literature%20Notes/Sartre.md)

## What I need to research:

- Maslow’s hierarchy of needs,
- Sartre’s philosophy,
- Kanyini schema, and
- how to write philosophical arguments.
