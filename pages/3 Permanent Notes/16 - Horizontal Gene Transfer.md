# 16 - Horizontal Gene Transfer

Horizontal gene transfer is the transfer of genetic material between two organisms that are not offspring and parent. Bacteria are good at this ([9,c - Bacteria](9,c%20-%20Bacteria.md)). They are able to pick up DNA fragments using pili to integrate into their genome. This is a way that antibacterial immunity develops.
