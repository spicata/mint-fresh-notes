# 4,3a - Why larger particles are less penetrative
$\alpha$ particles are significantly larger than $\beta$ particles and $\gamma$ rays, but also has significantly less penetration. However, this (may) seem counter-intuitive. A wrecking ball can more easily break through a wall than a bullet, and still have more energy left over. However, this is not what penetration is.

Penetration is the ability for a particle to *pass through* a substance, not the ability to *break through*[^1]. In this regard, a smaller particle will have an easier time “navigating” its way through a substance, and thus will be able to pass through more easily, whilst an $\alpha$ particle will have a harder time doing so, as it will get caught up in that substance.
