# 9 - Pathogens

Pathogens are organisms that cause diseases, who come in 4 different types: viruses, bacteria, fungi, and protists ([9 [Cheat] - Comparison Table](9%20[Cheat]%20-%20Comparison%20Table), [9,a - Eukaryotic, Prokaryotic](9,a%20-%20Eukaryotic,%20Prokaryotic), [9,b - Fungi](9,b%20-%20Fungi.md), [9,c - Bacteria](9,c%20-%20Bacteria.md)). These pathogens are also split into groups by their lifestyles; some only do it as an additional part of living, and do not depend on their hosts (facultative pathogens)[^1], whilst others need their hosts to survive (obligate pathogens). On top of that, obligate pathogens could inhabit different places during different stages of their life, such as malaria, whoâ€™s final (definitive) host are humans, but they are transmitted by a (intermediate, vector) hosts, which are mosquitos. Viruses must always be obligate.

For obligate pathogens, lethality does not always benefit the organism. This can be seen in the case of the Black Death, which killed so many people so quickly that it quickly died off as it was unable to spread and mutate any more. Compare this to the common cold[^2] ([12,a - HIV and AIDS](12,a%20-%20HIV%20and%20AIDS)).

Whilst most pathogens can live in a variety of hosts, this is not the case for viruses, which are much more picky in their hosts due to the nature of their internal mechanisms[^3]; they are adapted to only infect a certain host. This can be seen in the case of the bacteriophage[^4], which are so specially adapted that they are only able to hunt their specific host bacteria.

[^1]: What kind of facultative pathogens are there?
[^2]: Do all pathogens become more and more mild over time?  Would this happen to malaria and other deadly pathogens?
[^3]: What about their internal mechanisms make this harder?
[^4]: Bacteriophage?
