# 12,a - HIV and AIDS

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a sexually transmitted infection (STI) that targets and weakens the human immune system; currently, 38.4 million people have HIV (World Health Organisation, 2022).

| Demographic | Count        |
|:------------|:-------------|
| All         | 38.4 million |
| Adult       | 36.7 million |
| Female      | 19.7 million |
| Male        | 16.9 million |
| Children    |  1.7 million |  

## How HIV works

HIV is a retrovirus (a family of viruses that encode their genetic material as RNA), that can be transmitted through bodily fluids such as blood, semen, and vaginal fluids; common routes of transmission are through the use of unclean syringes - for either illicit drugs or in hospital - and sexual intercourse. 

HIV infects the human immune system, specifically helper T cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells; all essential parts to the correct functioning of this system. On top of that, HIV embeds itself within the lymphatic system, particularly the lymph nodes, where it may stay dormant (latent) for several years. In response to this infection, the body will often command these infected immune cells to undergo apoptosis (a way to “dispose” of cells safely). 

As more of these helper T and other immune cells are killed, the immune system becomes increasingly weakened, which allows for opportunistic pathogens to take hold in the body, and it sometimes leads to the development of cancer cells in the body.

## Symptoms

HIV is broken into 3 different phases: acute HIV, clinical latency (AKA chronic HIV), and symptomatic HIV. The acute HIV phase are indicated by the very first symptoms of HIV and occur shortly after the infection. Its symptoms include:
- A fever,
- Headache,
- A sore throat,
- Diarrhea,
- Weight loss, and
- Coughing.

These symptoms are similar to cold symptoms, and often so mild that people do not notice it, thus making it difficult to diagnose. Despite this, the viral load within the bloodstream is the high during this phase, allowing for the transmission of HIV. This is then proceeded by clinical latency: when HIV lays dormant for several years. This is accompanied by no symptoms. Finally, there is symptomatic HIV, which is the stage when the more severe symptoms appear, such as:
- Fever,
- Swollen lymph nodes,
- Pneumonia, and
- Shingles

Those with HIV are also more prone to getting sick. Eventually, if left untreated this can develop into autoimmune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).

## Treatment

Sadly, HIV cannot be cured, but luckily, it can be supressed. It is difficult to cure HIV as it remains embedded in the lymph nodes, where they can reproduce and re-enter the bloodstream. Using medications, we are able to kill all the HIV in the bloodstream, but without continual consumption of this drug, HIV return back into the bloodstream

A way to supress HIV is through antiretroviral therapy (ART)
