# 11,a - Vector

Vector graphics are a group of images that are rendered through the use of mathematical formulae that define their shape. Due to this limitation, they often simply contain lines, curves, and other rudimentary shapes. These are the best for designs due to their similarity, however, is not as great for photographs and other complex images. These vector images are most commonly used for fonts and logos, as they can be scaled up without losing resolution, and they also take up less storage.

They are often in the .pdf or in .svg.
