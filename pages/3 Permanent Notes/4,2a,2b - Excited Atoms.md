# 4,2a,2b - Excited Atoms

A ground state (for an atom) is the state containing the lowest possible energy, hence being the most stable formation. An excited state is a state where an atom contains more energy that this ground state. This usually entails that there are electrons that occupy a higher electron orbital, meaning that there is excess energy within the system of the atom. The electron will release this energy in the form of a X-ray.

A similar principle can be applied to the nucleons within a nucleus. Protons and neutrons can occupy a higher energy **nuclear shell**, and when returning to its ground state, it will release a gamma ray.
