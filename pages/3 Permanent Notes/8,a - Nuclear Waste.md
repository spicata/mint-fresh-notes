# 8,a - Nuclear Waste #Permanent 
Despite what public knowledge may say, nuclear reactor produce very little waste ([8,b-Types-of-Nuclear-Waste-and-Storage](8,b-Types-of-Nuclear-Waste-and-Storage)) due to nuclear power’s high energy to fuel ratio[^1], which is effectively contained within containment facilities run by various organisation around the world[^2]. This allows for the safe disposal of nuclear waste, unlike the by-products of fossil fuelled powerplant[^3].

Furthermore, what can be recycled of the depleted radioactive fuels is recycled into more radioactive fuels ([8,a,a - Nuclear Recycling](8,a,a%20-%20Nuclear%20Recycling)), which can continue to be reused within conventional nuclear reactors[^4].

[^1]: Why does fission produce so much energy.
[^2]: What example?
[^3]: → **Elaborate**, compare the by-products and severity 
[^4]: Thorium-232 is an example of something that cannot be used in conventional reactors.
