# 4,b,a - Neutron's Instability

Free floating neutrons have a half-life of about 15 minutes[^1]. This is because neutrons (up, down, down quarks) are a little heavier than protons (up, up, down quarks), and thus they want to decay down into protons, effectively making them more stable[^2].

Neutron-heavy nuclei are also rather unstable, due the above idea and because as the number of neutrons increase, they begin to occupy higher energy nuclear shells ([4,5c - Magic Numbers & Helium Stability](4,5c%20-%20Magic%20Numbers%20&%20Helium%20Stability.md)), which have more energy. By transmuting into a proton ([4,2a - Beta Decay (P)](4,2a%20-%20Beta%20Decay%20(P).md)), it not only makes itself more stable, but the entire system more stable by dropping down into a nuclear shell that has a lower energy.

[^1]: Why arenâ€™t some neutrons within nucleus unstable like they are when free-floating? What about it makes it different?
[^2]: Why are heavier things more unstable?
