# 8 - How a Nuclear Reactor Works 

Fuel assemblies (consisting of numerous pellets) are added into the reactor as the fuel, with one pellet containing about the same amount of energy as a tonne of coal. These assemblies were filled with radioactive materials (typically Uranium-235[^1]), and are surrounded by ceramic and metals[^2].  

The nuclear reaction starts as soon as neutrons hits the radioactive substance, causing some of the atoms to undergo fission (a form of cluster decay), which ejects even more neutrons, causing a chain reaction within the reactor.

Nuclear reactions, especially fission, are capable of generating large amounts of heat[^3]. Nuclear reactors and powerplants use this quality to generate electricity, by using this heat to evaporate water in vapour, which spins a turbine[^4], thus generating electricity. However, the nuclear chain reaction used in a nuclear powerplant can quickly get out of hand (see Chernobyl[^5]) and thus, to prevent overheating, water and control rods (made of radiation insulating material) are used. The water plays double duty (maybe triple) here, acting to control the heat in the reactor as well.
