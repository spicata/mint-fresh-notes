Text 1: Creativity is discovery, not invention

Text 2: Creativity requires one to be selective, and to discover new ground.

Text 1 and 2 both use a plethora of literary and visual techniques to show the processes required for one to be creative. In text 1, Michael Frayn argues that ideas “lure you on… into a new world”, the personification of ideas suggest that they are alive and exist externally from us, and thus must come from an external source of these ideas, such that nothing is completely original, and rather an adaptation of what came before.

He is further likened to “[the] presidential Captain Hook” in regard to his fearlessness with crocodiles, using an allusion further portray the idol-like status among the community. Finally, the idea that “everyone knew that this was Normal’s river” simply shows the how intertwined Normal Phantom’s identity and the river is.
