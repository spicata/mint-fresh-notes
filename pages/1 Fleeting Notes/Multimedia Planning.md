# Multimedia Planning

Down the middle there will be a tear line. On the left (smaller) side, it will be illustrated. I think size 3 pen for outline will be good. Try simplified colours to save time and to give it the stylised look. On the right side, apply some filters and use adjustment layers.

Put text on the “real” side, using maybe Garamond. Format it as a form of advertisement.
