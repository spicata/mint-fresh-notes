# Health Promotion

A good health promotion (about HIV) should focus on not only informing the public about a certain health concern, but also providing additional resources, how to approach the issue, and ways to mitigate the transmission. This is what I intend to do for my HIV health promotion. I would like to:
1. Inform the public on the impact of STIs, especially HIV;
2. How HIV works, as understanding something allows people to do something about it;
3. Prevention and treatment;
4. How to approach and talk about HIV; and
5. Provide external resources.
