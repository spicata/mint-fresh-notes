# Nuclear Physics Objectives

- [ ] I can recall a description of Bohrâ€™s model of the atom.
- [x] I can recall what is meant by atomic number, atomic mass, protons, neutrons (Year 9)
- [x] I can definitions of nucleons, strong nuclear force, electromagnetic force, radioactive decay
- [x] I can relate knowledge of strong nuclear force and (counters) electromagnetic force to the stability of nucleus. 
- [x] I can relate binding energy to stability of a nucleus and relate to nuclei becoming radioactive.
- [x] I can describe the different types of radiation (alpha, beta and gamma) and explain the differences between them.
- [x] I can identify specific materials that stop the different types of radiation.
- [x] I can write and balance nuclear reactions for radioactive decay
- [x] I can state what a half-life is and explain that different isotopes have different levels of stability.
- [x] I can interpret half-life graphs that measure mass, number of nuclei, percentage and activity (counts per sec/becquerels)
- [x] I can draw decay graphs given data and use the graph to calculate half-life.
- [ ] I can describe what fission and fusion are and explain the differences between them
- [x] I can predict energy changes as a result of fission and fusion reactions.
- [x] I can write and balance nuclear reactions for fission and fusion reactions
- [x] I can state what is meant by mass defect in a fission/fusion reaction and how it relates to the energy released in the reaction
- [x] I can describe the relationship between mass and energy using $E = mc^{2}$.
- [x] I can describe mass defect and binding energy and their relationship.
- [x] I can describe the main components of nuclear power stations. In particular, reactor vessel (encases and prevents radiation from escaping), the control rods (function in controlling nuclear reactions), fuel rods, steam generator (heat exchanger + turbine + generator), moderator (slows neutrons eg graphite or heavy water).
- [x] I can explain, in simple terms, how nuclear power stations work to generate electricity. A nuclear reactor is a device in which nuclear reactions are generated, and the chain reaction is controlled to release large amount of steady heat, thereby producing energy.
- [x] I can describe an uncontrolled reaction in terms of neutrons escaping too quickly to maintain a chain reaction, resulting in the rapid release of nuclear energy, causing an explosion. Contrast this with a controlled reaction.
- [x] I can analyse some advantages and disadvantages of using nuclear energy to generate electricity.
