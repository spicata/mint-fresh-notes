- Gamma ray (or photon) if nucleus is excited. Deexcites a nucleus
- Same wavelength as X-rays, but gamma originate from a nucleus, and x-rays are from the electron cloud.
- Cannot ionise themselves, but can excite other atoms.
- Could pass through lead.
- $^{Am}_{Z}X\to^A_{Z}X+^0_{0}\gamma$
- For half-life: $N=N_{0}\left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^n$
