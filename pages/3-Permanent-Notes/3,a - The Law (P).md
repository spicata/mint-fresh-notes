# 3,a - The Law #Permanent 
The Law is a slippery topic to define, however, it is commonly accepted as the common norms and values that are accepted in Aboriginal communities[^1], and sometimes spanning many communities. Unlike the laws found in Western culture ([[pages/3-Permanent-Notes/3,b - Western Laws (P)]]), Aboriginal customary law is immutable/fixed to humans[^2], as it was not created by us, but rather the spiritual ancestors that formed the world.
