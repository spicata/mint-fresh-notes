# 3,c - Teaching and Aboriginal #Permanent 
To develop a good theory of learning, one must consider the people being taught: the students. More importantly, language must be taken into consideration when teaching, as it moulds and shapes learning; this is a strong pedagogy. Despite the countless number of Aboriginal cultures, they all share some similarities, such as the concept that autonomy and social guidance should be balanced. When the pedagogy of two or more cultures overlap, and this is considered, then truly valuable learning occurs. This is about the Aboriginal pedagogy…
1. Story-telling,
2. Maps,
3. Non-verbal,
4. Signs,
5. Link to Land;
6. Shapes;
7. Visualisations; and
8. Community ties.

When information in weaved into a story, it will facilitate better learning, as context plays a major role in learning. What is learning if it is just of independent and isolated bits of information if it cannot be connected with other pieces of knowledge? Without context, one cannot learn effectively. Stories allow for that context.

Nature and geographical landmarks can act as a map or inspiration for a project, as the road to learning is not one that goes straight towards the end, but one that winds and curves. The best path is not always shortest, but one that allows for the maximum learning; similarly, the map does not lead one towards the fastest way, but through the best. Moreover, it can be important to 

Furthermore, learning does not have to be verbal. On top of that, learning can be enhanced when students are encouraged to find meaning in the gaps, tones, and the motions, as these actions are ultimately say more that words can. Not only this,  but signs are also a great way to learn, such as the image shown underneath.

These aspects are not static steps, but rather an interconnected and dynamic system of processes. On top of that, it could be more useful to tie ideas and words to symbols and images rather than other words, as these can represent concepts where languages fail us.
