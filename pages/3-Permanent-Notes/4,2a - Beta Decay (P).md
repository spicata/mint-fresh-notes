# 4,2a - Beta Decay #Permanent 
Beta decay is another way that unstable nuclei can achieve stability ([[pages/3-Permanent-Notes/4,2a,a - Beta or Alpha decay]]). It occurs when neutrons transform into a proton (positron) and a electron (negatron)[^2], increasing stability by increasing the proton to neutron ratio. The electron is tiny, and so it can be ejected from the nucleus as an incredibly high speed[^3]. This is the $\beta$ particle.

Beta decay has higher penetration, as the smaller particle allows it to fit through more gaps in a surface than the $\alpha$ particle. However, it has a lower ionisation ability as it needs to not only be closer due its size[^4], but also because it has a weaker charge.[^5]

Type of Decay | General Formula (A is atomic Mass, Z is atomic number)
--- | ---
Alpha Decay | $^A_{Z}X\to^A_{Z+1}Y+^0_{-1}\beta$

It often appears with gamma radiation ([[pages/3-Permanent-Notes/4,2a,2a - Gamma Decay]]). A prime example of beta decaying substance would be bismuth-214.

[^1]: Why then, does it sometimes undergo beta decay and sometimes alpha decay
[^2]: Is this true? (It is not)
[^3]: As the amount of protons in a nuclei increases, does the “ejection speed” also increase?
[^4]: Why does size play a part in ionisation
[^5]:Because the $-1$ charge of $\beta$ particle is weaker than the $+2$ charge of the $\alpha$ particle.
