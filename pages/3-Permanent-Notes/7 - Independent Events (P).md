# 7 - Independent Events #Permanent 
In probability, independent events are events that are not affected by any previous events, such as flipping a coin. A coin flip remains unaffected by any flips before it[^1]. The probability of an independent events $A$ and $B$ both occur can be found by multiplying the probability of both events ($P(A\cap B)=P(A)\times P(B)$).

However, we know that $P(A\cap B)=P(A)\times P(B|A)$, thus we know that $P(B)=P(B|A)$.

[^1]: Even if it has done heads 999 times, that still means that the probability for heads is $50\%$ and the probability for tails is $50\%$. It might, however, be a good indication that the coin is rigged.
