# 8,a,c - Thorium #Permanent 
The use of thorium-232 in nuclear reactors is an interesting proposition that has a lot of potential in the future to replace the standard uranium-235 reactors, and it comes with a variety of advantages, as well as some disadvantages.

Thorium on its own is not a fissile material, and cannot undergo nuclear fission. However, similar to uranium-238, it has the capability of transmuting into fissile element, making thorium-232 fertile. It must first have a neutron added to it, becoming thorium-233, which follows this decay chain: Thorium-233 —$\beta$→ Protactinium-233 —$\beta$→ Uranium-233.

Uranium-232 is another isotope of uranium that can undergo nuclear fission chains. Sadly, conventional reactors cannot use this thorium-uranium cycle, only the uranium-plutonium cycle, however, there exists massive thorium reserves in India, and thus they are likely going to be the country leading thorium-reactor development.

Thorium is considered superior to uranium due to a variety of reasons. Firstly, there is more thorium that there is uranium on Earth (approximately 3 times more). Secondly, it does not produce any heavier elements unlike the uranium-plutonium cycle, meaning that the waste from thorium reactors will last considerably shorter than the waste of uranium reactors. Thirdly, it largely mitigates the ability to use it to create a bomb, as it itself is not fissile, and only the uranium-232 produced by it is.

However, the most interesting prospect for thorium is its possible usage in thorium breeder reactors, as thorium are perfectly suited for breeding. Thorium can use slow reactors, as much more neutrons are produced per fission reaction. The utilisation of thorium may encourage the development of breeder reactors, which will reduce the amount of nuclear waste that we produce.
