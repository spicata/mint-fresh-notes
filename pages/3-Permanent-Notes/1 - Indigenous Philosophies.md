# 1 - Indigenous Philosophies #Permanent 
Actions cannot be paved by philosophy. This statement is self-evident since otherwise, why would there be environmental collapse and wars caused by humanity? Either this is accepted, or there is a fundamental piece of philosophy that we are missing.[^1] Indigenous philosophies are a possible solution to a global, collective philosophy that can patch up some of these problems.[^2]

 Being Indigenous has more than just being first[^3], but also to have maintained a strong bond to the land[^4]. There are many of these Indigenous cultures that exist, yet they are all equally afraid of becoming a homogenised group through the facets of language. [^5]%%**Elaborate on this fear**%%

In Western and Eastern religions, God is either placed inside or outside of the world. An alternative to this idea would be that God is the world, which is the idea that Indigenous philosophies around the world has adopted.[^6] On top of that, it rejects the monistic (as things are evidently distinct) and dualistic (as this creates an “us-them” situation) thoughts found in Western and Eastern religions, and simply acknowledges the complexity and nuance that is a part of this universe.[^7]

As philosophy acts as a culmination of different perspectives[^8], the adoption of Indigenous Philosophy benefits philosophic growth. It would also allow for the integration of Indigenous people into society and for sustainable growth through the wisdom found in Indigenous philosophies. %%**Elaborate**%%

[^2]: To be honest, do we need a perfect philosophy? Much like Aboriginal spirituality, could we not just accept the fact that complexities exist in the world.
[^3]: Explaining what it means to be Indigenous.
[^4]: Hence why Indigenous people found tooth and nail to protect their lands.
[^5]: How powerful is language, really?
[^6]: Indigenous philosophies, though separated around the world, are similar in their particular circumstances.
[^7]: How did they deal with this complexity and nuance. Did they simply accept it, or did the seek to change it?
[^8]: Is it possible to adopt every philosophy at once? Surely not.
