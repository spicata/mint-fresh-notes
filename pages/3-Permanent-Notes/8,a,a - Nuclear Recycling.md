# 8,a,a - Nuclear Recycling #Permanent 
It is important to understand that, in a nuclear reactor, uranium-235 is most often used as a main fuel, however, it comes mixed the much more common uranium-238, which is essentially useless. This means that only about 1% of the total possible energy extracted is actually extracted in a nuclear powerplant, with most of it remaining in the uranium-238.

However, it is also this quality that makes nuclear fuel recyclable. If a neutron is added to uranium-238, it becomes uranium-239, which will quickly decay (around 30 minutes) to $\beta$ decay into neptunium-239, which in turn will become plutonium-239, which is another fuel that can be used in conventional nuclear reactors. Thus, nuclear fuel is recyclable.
