# 4,4a - After Decay #Permanent 
An atom undergoes decay to become more stable, however, even after the decay, the atom may still remain unstable. In this case, it will continue to undergo more decay. This is the case of Uranium-238, which $\alpha$ decays into Thorium-234, which $\beta$ decays into Protactinium-234.
