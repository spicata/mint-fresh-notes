# 4,5a - The Helium Nucleus #Permanent 
Alpha decay is the most common form of cluster decay, a type of decay where a nucleus splits into two or more smaller clusters of neutrons and protons[^1]. Its frequency is a result of the special properties of the helium nucleus. The helium nucleus is extremely stable and has a incredibly high binding energy[^2].

On top of that, the protons and neutrons inherently form pseudo-helium nuclei inside of another nucleus[^3], and thus, when decaying, split off a helium nucleus.

[^1]: What is the difference between fission and cluster decay?
[^2]: Why though? Is it to do with the geometry?
[^3]: Is this due to the stability of helium-4?
