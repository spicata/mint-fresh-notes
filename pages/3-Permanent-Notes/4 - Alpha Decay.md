# 4 - Alpha Decay #Permanent 
Radioactive decay is the process that atoms undergo to become more stable by releasing energy or particles ([4,4a - After Decay (P)](4,4a%20-%20After%20Decay%20(P)), [8 - How a Nuclear Reactor Works](8%20-%20How%20a%20Nuclear%20Reactor%20Works)). A type of this is alpha decay, which releases alpha particles ([4,a - Why does it release alpha particles](4,a%20-%20Why%20does%20it%20release%20alpha%20particles)) ($\alpha$ particles), which is identical to a helium nucleus ([4,5a - The Helium Nucleus](4,5a%20-%20The%20Helium%20Nucleus)) (two protons and two neutrons.)

Alpha decay is extremely slow, short-reaching, and not penetrative ([4,3a - Why larger particles are less penetrative (P)](4,3a%20-%20Why%20larger%20particles%20are%20less%20penetrative%20(P))), which means that alpha-emitters are relatively safe, and able to be stopped by a sheet of paper. However, it is extremely ionising[^1] due to its mass, meaning that it can wreak havoc on cells when it comes into close contact with them[^2].
