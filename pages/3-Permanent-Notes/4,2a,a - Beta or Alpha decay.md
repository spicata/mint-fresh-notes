# 4,2a,a - Beta or Alpha decay #Permanent 

>$\beta^-$, $\beta^+$, and $\alpha$ decay are all things that atoms undergo to become more stable, however, why? Why do some atoms undergo $\beta^-$ and others $\alpha$ decay?

![../../assets/Type of Decay graph.png](../../assets/Type%20of%20Decay%20graph.png)

In the above graph, the line of black squares indicates stable atoms, and it acts as a divider between $\beta^-$ and $\beta^+$/$\alpha$ decay. $\beta^-$ decay always occurs to the left of the stability line, as the conversion of a neutron to a proton will move the nucleus right-down on the graph. This will mean that the nuclei will only become more stable if it was already on the left of the stability line. The opposite is true for $\beta^+$ decay. 

As for $\alpha$ decay, as it will lead to the loss of both two neutrons and two protons, and thus will move parallel (towards the origin) to the N=Z line. This means that it will only become more stable when it is on the right of stability line.
