# 2 - Aboriginal Worldview, Land  #Permanent 
In the Aboriginal worldview, the land holds great spiritual significance, and Aboriginal societies depend on it[^1], both physically and spiritually. These land are especially important as they are seen as the resting places of massive, ancient spirits.[^4] These spirits formed the land through their interactions, and are credited with teaching humanity about the Law[^5], and are the ancestors of everything that live in Australia.

Everyone is thought to contain a part of these spirits[^3], and therefore responsible for the descendants. This focus inevitably led to a worldview focused on the long-term benefits and detriments, as it would (obviously) have a great impact on their lives[^2].
