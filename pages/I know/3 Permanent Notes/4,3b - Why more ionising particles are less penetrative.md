# 4,3b - Why more ionising particles are less penetrative

To add to the limitation that size plays on a the penetration of a particle, the ionisation plays a further role. A particle that ionises and interacts with matter more frequently also loses more energy than one that ionises less, and thus more ionising particles are less penetrative and vice versa.
