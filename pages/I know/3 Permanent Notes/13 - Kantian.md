# 13 - Kantian

Kant was a deontologist; actions were only justified by duty and common will. What is the duty? It is the categorical imperative ([13a - Categorical Imperative](13a%20-%20Categorical%20Imperative)). A society built on that? The Kingdom of Ends. Only goodwill is universal, all other virtues are not.
