# 3,b - Western Laws #Permanent 
There are two laws present in Western culture[^1], which are natural laws and positive laws. Natural laws are laws that describes a part of the universe, like the Law of Thermodynamics. Although these laws represent a part of the universe, the laws themselves are created and altered by human[^2]. Positive laws are the enforced laws that is created by the Legislature. These laws, too, are created by humans. Unlike natural laws, they are (even) more of a social construct, and quite meaningless out of context[^3].
