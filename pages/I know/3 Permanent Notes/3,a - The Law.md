# 3,a - The Law
The Law is a slippery topic to define, however, it is commonly accepted as the common norms and values that are accepted in Aboriginal communities[^1], and sometimes spanning many communities. Unlike the laws found in Western culture ([[3,b - Western Laws]]), Aboriginal customary law is immutable/fixed to humans[^2], as it was not created by us, but rather the spiritual ancestors that formed the world ([[3 - Aboriginal Worldview, Society (P)]]).

[^1]: What happens when one breaks these Laws?
[^2]: Does this imply that it does not change in interpretation every generation?
