# 9,a - Eukaryotic, Prokaryotic

Eukaryotic cells have a membrane-bound organelle, and thus also a nucleus. Prokaryotic cells do not have these. Due to this restriction, they are often more simple than their eukaryotic counterparts. Eukaryotes also contain mitochondria, something that prokaryotic cells lack.

When it comes to genetic material, there are some resounding differences between eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells. Prokaryotes have a single loop of DNA, and sometimes some extra plasmids, which is extra genetic material. Eukaryotes have linear DNA, which is organised into many different chromosomes.
