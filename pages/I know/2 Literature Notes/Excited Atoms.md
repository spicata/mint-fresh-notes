# Excited Atoms

- A ground state is the lowest energy state
	- An excited state is one that has a higher energy y than the ground state
- This can mean that an electron is in a higher orbital than needed
	- X-rays are a release of that energy
- It can also be a nuclear isomer
	- Same principle as the electron shells but with nucleons
	- When it comes back to the ground state, it releases gamma rays.
