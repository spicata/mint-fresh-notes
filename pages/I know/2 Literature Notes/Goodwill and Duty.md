# Goodwill and Duty

- Duty is action according to moral law
	- Moral law is tested through the imperatives
		- If applied universally without contradiction and ability to be willed, it is moral
- One can act from duty or with duty
	- People you act with duty do it for extrinsic benefit
	- People with goodwill act from duty
		- Goodwill is the continuation to act duty-ly through difficulty
