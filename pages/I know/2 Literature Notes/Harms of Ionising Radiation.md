# Harms of Ionising Radiation
- Alpha decay, is strong, but not far
- Big problem if it gets in you
	- Same goes for beta
- Beta is also able to penetrate skin (slightly)
- Gamma will destroy you
- These destroy the internal processes of a cell, leading to cell death
	- Sometimes cancer if unlucky

## ARS

- Lots of radiation, short time
- Internal organs must be damaged
