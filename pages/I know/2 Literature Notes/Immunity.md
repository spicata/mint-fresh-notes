# Immunity

- Natural vs artifical; passive vs active
	- Natural happens naturally; artificial happens artificially
		- % I am not sure what more to say
	- Active involves our own immune system (our own antibodies)
	- Passive involes injection of antibodies
		- Short-term, and also our bodies will create antibodies to fight antibodies
