# 10TCS - Cooling
## Cooling in Computers
Cooling is used to keep the computer hardware (predominantly CPU) cool, as if a computer overheats, it can cause the performance to suffer.
Although it exists in laptops, it is more closely related to desktops.
The principle of air and water cooling is the same. It draws heat from the computer away.

### Air Cooling

The heat generated by the CPU is transfered to the integrated heat spreader (IHS), and moves to the CPU Cooler Baseplate (because that's what heat does).
The heat that is then transferred into a heat pipe, and then moved to a heat sink, which is usually a plate with many pins or flaps that allows heat to be dissipated faster into the cooler air.

3 common types of heat sinks: pins, straights, and flared fins.

The now hot air is then forced out by the fans.
#### A Short Tangent: Heat pipes
Heat pipes are compromised of an outer shell called the envelope, and inner absorptive lining called the wick, and a working fluid.
The working fluid is usually condesned in the wick, however, when heat is applied (in the evaporator region), the working fluid evaporates and is sent down the pipe (to a condensor region), where it will give up its heat and return back into the wick, where it is passively pumped back into the evaporator region.
#### A Short Tangent: Passive Coolers
Passive coolers are speciallised heat sinks that do not require a fan to work.
These can be better in less energy intensive environment, however, is not usually preferred.
### Water Cooling
Water cooling can fall into two main types:
#### All in One (AIO)

The heat generated by the CPU, instead of being transferred by a heat pipe, is fed into a waterblock, which, despite the name of this entire system of cooling, is filled with coolant, and not water.
The heat is absorbed by the coolant, and moves up one of the tubes to the radiator, which exposes the liquid to air, cooling it.
The now cooler coolant is sent back into the waterblock.
#### Custom Cooling Loops
A custom cooling loops is a water cooling system that incorporates the systems that user prefers, instead of purchasing a AIO system.
This requires the owner to purchase their own waterblock, reservoir, pump, radiator, fittings, and tubes.
It is much more expensive and time-consuming to install a custom cooling loop compared to an AIO system.
