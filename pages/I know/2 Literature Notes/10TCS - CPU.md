## CPU
- The wires that *go into the CPU* are split into: **Control buses, address buses, and data buses**.
- CPU is split into **CU (Control Unit), ALU (Arithmetic logic unit), Registry, and system clock**
- **CU** controls, **ALU** calculates, **Registry** stores, and **System clock** counts
### Fetch Cycle
- **Fetch cycle** is the way CPUs work
- **Fetch**(CU)-> **Decode**(CU) -> **Process**(ALU) -> **Store**(RAM)
