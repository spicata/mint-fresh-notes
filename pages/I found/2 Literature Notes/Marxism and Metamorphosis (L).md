- Gregor is a travelling salesman (part of the proletariats). 
- He despises his job, is forced to work due to economic necessity, to support both himself and his family, and is unable to produce an income any other way.
- The chief-clerk is quintessential example of a bourgeoise: clearly having no work for himself, and primarily concerned with the output of his employees.
- Every relationship was tied to a monetary purpose, similarly to how Marx portrayed relationship in *The Communist Manifesto*. Familial relationships breakdown as Gregor is unable to support his family, and the chief-clerk abandons him as soon as he cannot produce anymore output.
	- As he was a financial burden, the passing of him is **CELEBRATED** ðŸ¤¨.
