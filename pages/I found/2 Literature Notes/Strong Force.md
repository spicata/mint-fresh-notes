# Strong Force

- One of four fundamental forces
- Strong force holds not only nuclei together, but also the quarks within protons and neutrons (hadrons)
- Quarks come in flavours, and in colours
- Boson transmit forces. Gluons transmit the strong force that keep everything together.
	- These gluons have a limit, and thus that is why strong force has a small effect area.
	- This occurs between quarks
- Some of this force happens outside of the nucleon (residual)
	- This is what keeps nuclei together
- Too little protons means not enough strong force. Too many means that electromagnetic takes over.
