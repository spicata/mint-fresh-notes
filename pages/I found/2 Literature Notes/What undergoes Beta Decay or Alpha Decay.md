# What undergoes Beta Decay or Alpha Decay #Literature 
- Heavier atoms tend to undergo $\alpha$ decay, as seen at the tip of the graph. This is because undergoing $\alpha$ decay means moving parallel to the N=Z line. This only moves closer to the stable nuclei when it is on right and up of a stable nuclei. 
- $\beta^-$ decay occurs to the left of the the stable nuclei. $\beta^+$ decay occurs on the right.
- Gamma just goes with.
