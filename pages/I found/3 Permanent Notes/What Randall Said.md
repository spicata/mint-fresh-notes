We need the acknowledgement of the suffering of Indigenous peoples in the past despite it being painful, as we can then mend the bridges burnt and work together to correct the wrongdoings of the past; we must overcome the pain ([[Nietzsche Loves Pain]]). We must also work together to form an Australia that incorporates both cultures ([[Kanyini]]).
