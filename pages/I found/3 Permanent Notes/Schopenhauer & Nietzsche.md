Schopenhauer believed that pain is the eternal constant, the foundation of the world. Pleasure is merely an alleviation of suffering. Short-lived, fleeting. It is our awareness of time that ruins life for us, snuffs out desires, mulls over mistakes. Thus, the less we want, the less we lose, and the less we hurt.

Nietzsche though Schopenhauer was a bozo. Life is suffering, but Nietzsche believed we should simply deal with it. With pain arises pleasure ([[Nietzsche Loves Pain]]).

e.g. Live in a padding room your whole life, or get out there and strive through suffering.
