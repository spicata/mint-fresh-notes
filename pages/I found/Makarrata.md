*Makarrata* is a treaty, a ritual done to right a wrong. The wrongs of the “settlers” of Australia, who invaded and massacred the First Nations peoples ([[Uluru on Invasion](Uluru%20on%20Invasion.md)). *Makarrata* wishes to reestablish their *Tjukurrpa*[^1], which is their traditional constitution and law — signifying their sovereignty and self-determination ([[2%20Literature%20Notes/Kanyini.md]], [[3,a - The Law](3,a%20-%20The%20Law.md)).
