Here we are now, where the sea and sky meet. Diamond stars twinkle high above; point any out, that’s where we’ll set our sights. It’s our future hopes, our coming wishes; but forget it for the moment, and we can just have fun. 

We’ll have arrived sooner that you could’ve thought, but once we’ve tasted the sweetness of the journey, we’d probably continue. Enjoying the time along the way.
