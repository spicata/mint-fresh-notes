# A Report on Nuclear Physics

## Decay

Radicative decay is a process that unstable atoms (particularly nuclei) undergo to achieve a more stable stable (lower energy). Within Nuclear Physics, this is catogorside into three large types: Alpha ($\alpha$) decay, beta ($\beta$) decay, and gamma ($\gamma$) decay. What decides what form of decay is undergoene depends on which way the nucleus is unstable.

### Alpha Decay

Alpha decay is the first form of decay we will look at. Alpha decay releases an alpha particle from the nucleus of the atom; the particle consists of 2 neutrons and 2 protons, identical to a helium nucleus. 

Although alpha decay has an incredibly high ionisation power due to its strong charge, it does not travel far and has little penetration. Alpha emitters are safe out of the body as alpha particles are unable to penetrate skin. However, once inside the body, its high ionising power can wreck havoc against cells.

### Beta Decay

Beta decay comes in two forms: positive beta ($^-\beta$) decay and negative beta decay
