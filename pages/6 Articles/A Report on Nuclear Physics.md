# A Report on Nuclear Physics

## Decay

Radicative decay is the process where an unstable nucleus ejects energy or particles to achieve a more stable state. Within Nuclear Physics, this is catogorside into three large types: Alpha ($\alpha$) decay, beta ($\beta$) decay, and gamma ($\gamma$) decay. What decides what form of decay is undergoene depends on which way the nucleus is unstable.

### Alpha Decay

Alpha decay is the first form of decay we will look at. Alpha decay releases an alpha particle from the nucleus of the atom; the particle consists of 2 neutrons and 2 protons, identical to a helium nucleus. It is denoted as: $^A_ZX\to^{A-4}_{Z-2}Y+^4_2\alpha$.

Although alpha decay has an incredibly high ionisation power due to its strong charge, it does not travel far and has little penetration (explained later). Alpha emitters are safe out of the body as alpha particles are unable to penetrate skin. However, once inside the body, its high ionising power can wreck havoc against cells.

#### Binding Energy & Exploration of the Alpha Particle

Mass defect is the mass difference between the individual constiuents of an atom and the atom itself; the constiuents always have a higher mass. This difference is accounted for by the binding energy, which is the energy that is released when nucleons come together into a nucleus. Mass can be converted to energy by $E=mc^2$. Mass defect itself is denoted by $\Delta M=(Zm_p+Nm_n)-M_A$. The higher the binding energy, the more stable a nucleus tends to be.

The reason why a helium nucleus is released has to do with the astonishing stability of said nucleus. The helium nucleus has an average binding energy per nucleon of about 7 MeV. Compare this to hydrogen-3's binding energy of less than 3 MeV and lithium-6's of around 5.5 MeV. Helium is only eventually surpassed by carbon-12. This is because of magic numbers.

##### Magic Numbers

The principle of electron shells can be applied to the nucleus. The nucleus is made up of layers of nuclear shells. Unlike an electron shell, there exists two nuclear shells for each layer: one for protons, another for neutrons. When these shells are filled, the nucleus tends to be more stable. These magic numbers are: 2, 8, 20, 28, 50, 82, and 126.

When both the shells are filled, the nucleus is doubly-magic, and tends to be especially stable. This is the case for helium-4.

##### Stability of Iron-56

Iron-56 is special, as it is not magical. Despite this, it has the lowest mass per nucleon[^2] and has the third highest binding energy per nucleon[^3]. Due to its incredibly stability, most fission and fusion reactions (below) tend toward iron-56. 

### Beta Decay

Beta decay comes in two forms: beta positive ($\beta^+$) decay and beta negative ($\beta^-$) decay. Beta negative decay is far more common, involving a neutron decaying into a proton, releasing a beta particle (electron) and an antineutrino. It is denoted as: $^A_ZX\to^{A}_{Z+1}Y+^0_{-1}\beta+\overline v$. 

There also exists beta positive decay, which is the opposite process, a protons decaying into a neutron, releasing a positron and a neutrino, denoted as $^A_ZX\to^{A}_{Z-1}Y+^0_{+1}\beta+v$. This is rarer on the account that a proton is lighter than a neutron, meaning that it would require some input energy to transmute.

Beta particles are moderatly ionsing, moderatly penetrative, and travel moderatly fast. Much like alpha emitters, beta emmiters are much more dangerous within the body, but external beta emmiters are also capable of causing "beta burns".

### Gamma Decay

Gamma decay occurs when an excited atom reaches its ground state, releasing a small photon (a small packet of energy): the gamma ray. It is identical to an X-ray, except for the place of origin[^1]. It is denoted as $^{Am}_ZX\to^A_ZX+^0_0\gamma$. Gamma decay often accompanies the other forms of decay.

Gamma particles are extremely penetrating and can travel long distances, but they have a small ionsiation ability.

### Relationship between ionsiation, particle size, and penetration

Penetration is a particle's ability to *pass through* an object. In this regard, it is harder for a larger particle to navigate through a substance, whereas a smaller particle finds it easier. As particle size increases, penetration decreases.

Highly ionising particles have a similar problem. Higher ionsiation ability would mean that the particle interacts with more matter with more energy. Thus, as ionisaiton ability increases, penetration decreases.
