# 4,a - Why does it release alpha particles
 
 As nuclei become larger and larger, the strong nuclear force between the protons weaken (as the distance between protons length), which allows electromagnetic forces[^1] to become the dominant force, which causes the nucleus to become unstable. To make the nucleus more stable, the atom releases these $\alpha$ particles so that it can shorten the distances between protons in an attempt to become more stable [4,5a - The Helium Nucleus](4,5a%20-%20The%20Helium%20Nucleus).
