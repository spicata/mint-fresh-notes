# 4,2a,2a - Gamma Decay 
Gamma ($\gamma$) decay is yet another form of radioactive decay. However, unlike the other forms of decay, $\gamma$ decay occur not because it a nuclear is unstable, as even stable nuclei can undergo $\gamma$ decay. Rather, $\gamma$ decay makes an atom unexcited ([4,2a,2b - Excited Atoms](../../../../3%20Permanent%20Notes/4,2a,2b%20-%20Excited%20Atoms.md)), releasing a photon in the process (energy particles) (known as a $\gamma$ ray).

It is denoted in the form $^{ Am }_{Z}X\to^{ A }_{Z}X+^{ 0 }_{0}\gamma$. Note that $^{ Am }$ indicates that the atom is excited, and that the parent nucleus does not change. Gamma decay often accompanies other types of decay.

When compared to X-rays, it is essentially the same, except that X-rays originate from the electron cloud and gamma rays from the nucleus.
