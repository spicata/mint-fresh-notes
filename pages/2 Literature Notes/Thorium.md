# Thorium #Literature 
- Thorium atoms (Th-232), although not fissile by themselves, are fertile, transmuting into uranium-233 when absorbing a neutron, which is fissile.
	- Th-232 → Th-233 —$\beta$→ Pa-233 —$\beta$→ U-233
- Conventional reactors cannot use thorium-uranium cycles, only uranium-plutonium cycles.
- Apparently China and India has large thorium reserves

- Thorium (uranium-233) is advantageous when used in breeder reactors, as it can be a slow reactor (not a fast reactor), as more neutrons are produced per fission than uranium-235.
- On top of that, it does not produce any heavier elements.
- However, we do not yet have much experience with it
- It also largely mitigated the ability to use it as a bomb.
- **Check out molten salt reactors**
