# Breeder Reactors #Literature 
- Breeder reactors are nuclear reactors that will produce more fissile material than is put into the system.
- This occurs because it allows infertile material to become fertile, by hitting it with a neutron to become unstable
- Breeder reactors are not renewable, just more efficient.
- It integrates the recycling plant into the reactor (essentially)
- They have to be fast reactors, as otherwise the neutrons will not hit the uranium-238 with sufficient energy to make it uranium-239
- It is still experimental technologies, and not properly done due to fear of making nuclear weapons more accessible.
