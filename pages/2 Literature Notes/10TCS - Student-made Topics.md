# 10TCS - Student-made Topics
## Chapter 1: Operating System [^1]
- Operating System (OS)
- *Android, Apples macOS, Linux OS, Apple iOS, Microsoft Windows*
- Launches and manages applications
- Manages devices
- Allows **APIs**
- *Windows API allows programs to get input from the keyboard*
- **User interfaces**: *Command-line interface (CLI), Graphic user interface (GUI)*
- CLI uses a terminal where users use the keyboard to interact with the computer
- GUI uses graphics where users interact with the graphics to interact with the computer
- Most used by casuals
- **1950s: Programs run by punch cards**
- Very slow
- As computer became more wide spread, difference showed up, making compatibility hard.
- Divergent evolution
- OS was created to combat this.
## Chapter 2: Programming Languages [^2]
- **Computer programming** - a set of instructions given to a computer to complete.
- It is the medium to talk to computers.
- Computers talks in binary, but we don't.
- Humans made higher level languages to streamline programming.
- Uses words from the english language
- A lot of p.langs exist.
- **C** is a general-purpose, procedural p.lang
- Made in 1972 by Dennis Ritchie, a successor of **B**
- Tied into Unix.
- ANSI (1980s) standarised C
- **C++** is just a continuation of C
- Bjarne Stroustrup (1985) made C++
- **Java** is an alternative C++
- Made in 1990s
- Was made to work with devices
- **Javascript** (ECMAscript) created by Brandon Eich (1995)
- For Netscape 2
- Makes the internet more interactive.
- Very popular.
- **C#** exists
- **HTML** and **CSS** are usually used together.
- HTML means Hypertext Markup Language
- CSS is Cascading Style Sheets.
- CSS is for designing the website.
>"You know, it would be cool if we could make it not look like crap" -Oliver Grant
- **Python** is general purpose
- Made by Guido van Rossum (1991)
- Much more simple
## Chapter 3: Cryptography [^3]
 - Pratice of **secure communication**
 - drv. Greek: *kryptos*, hidden
 - **Confidentiality**, **Non-repudiation**, **integrity**, **authenticity**
 - **Caesar Cipher**: sub. cipher
 - *frick*
 - **Symmetric cryptography** - *single* key, for encryption and decryption
 - **Assymetric cryptography** - *two* keys, one for locking, one for unlocking.
 - **Hash functions** - *one way*, unsolvable without rainbow tables
 - **SHA** - **Secure Hash Algorithm**, used to store passwords.
 - *frick*
 - **Caeser cipher** and **Enigma machine**
 - Important for *transfering sensitive information*
 - **Vigenere**, **railway**, e.g.
## Chapter 4: Computer Components [^4]
- **Graphic cards** are expensive
- Renders graphic on the screen
- Has a large cooling system
- **CPUs** are the brains of a computer
- Made of many **dies**, underneath a large **heat spreader**
- **Motherboard** is the nervous system of the computer
- Computer components are plugged into it
- **Storage** are SSDs and HDDs
- **RAM** is the short-term memory.
- Quite fast
- Usually clears on a shutdown.
- **Power supply** is a battery
- **Cooling** is usually a fan, but also water cooling
- **Case, tower, chassis** is the skeleton of a computer.
- **Output devices** is where output appears, like a *monitor*
- **Software** is an *intangible* part of a computer
- **Operating systems, Applications, and Utility software**
- **Input devices** are ways you interact with the device
## Chapter 5: Quantum Computing
- **Computers** + **Quantum physics** = **Quantum Computing**
- **Superpositions** is the uncertainty of a bit
- Normal computers are **binary**
- **Quantum computers** uses quantum bits, or *qubits*
- *Very* efficient
- **Qubits** are volatile
- Hard to produce
