# Magic Numbers & Helium Stability

- Nucleons are organised in shells. When filled, these are more stable.
	- Like the noble gases
- Different shells for both the protons and the neutrons
- Shells contain different number of nucleons. These are “magic numbers”
- The magic numbers are: 2, 8, 20, 28, 50, 82, and 126
- Helium-4 has an incredibly high stability due to this (2 protons, 2 neutrons; both filled)
	- These magic numbers could mean that certain (heavy) elements could be stable
- If both shells are filled, even more stably (doubly magic)
- Calcium-40 is also doubly magic.
- He-4 is also a noble gas, making it inert and stable (magic number moment)
