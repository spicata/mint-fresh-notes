# Nuclear Reactor & Waste #Literature 
- Nuclear reactions (fission) occurs in the reactor, generating heat, which evaporates water in vapour.
- To prevent it from overheating, water and control rods are used. 
- Fuel (assemblies) are added into the reactor as the fuel, with one pellet containing about the same amount of energy as a tonne of coal.
- Produces very little waste, which is effectively contained.
- Some of this waste can be recycled into more (radioactive) fuels to continue to be reused. (+2)
- Nuclear power has a high fuel to energy ratio.
- Nuclear waste is disposed of safely (unlike coal)

- Low-level waste in most common, stored ~~haphazardly~~ “well”. However, this doesn’t matter because they only contain a miniscule amount of radiation
- Intermediate and high-level waste is more dangerous, however, is stored safely/is not produced at all.
