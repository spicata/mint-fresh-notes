# HIV Structure

- 2 Positive-sense RNA with 9.2 kilobase. 
- Spherical (100-120 nm), but contains cone capsid.
	- Capsid protects RNA, envelope protects capsid.
		- ? Fullerene capsid
	- Envelope is lipid bi-layer
		- Stolen from cell, thus has proteins, such as **major histocompatibility** molecules
			- ! This is a peeking window into the cell
		- It also has the viral spike glycoproteins
			- gp41 and gp120
				- These attach to the CD4 glycoprotein found on many immune cells, especially the CD4+ Helper T cell [HIV Spike Glycoproteins](HIV%20Spike%20Glycoproteins)
- Like the glycoproteins, the structural proteins are also cleaved from one large protein.
	- Gag polyprotein are broken up by protease
- HIV contains many structures within itself
