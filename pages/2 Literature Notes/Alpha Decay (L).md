# Alpha Decay #Literature 
- Radioactive decay is a process that atoms undergo to become more stable, by releasing energy/particles
- Alpha decay releases alpha particles ($\alpha$ particles), which are identical to a helium nucleus (two protons and two neutrons)
- It is extremely slow, short-reaching, and not penetrative, however, it is extremely ionising.
- If an alpha-emitter comes into contact with cells (such as eating, breathing, or injecting), it can cause lasting cellular damage. 

Type of Decay | General Formula (A is atomic Mass, Z is atomic number)

Alpha Decay | $^A_{Z}X\to^{A-4}_{Z-2}Y+^4_{2}\alpha$
