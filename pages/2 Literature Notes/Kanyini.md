# Kanyini

- Everyone just wants to at home.
	- We demolished the oldest home.
- Aboriginal Australians knew their home well, and took care of it.
	- You don’t defile your home.
- Everything is connected; everything is family.
- What’s there is there because it works.
- Not bound to anything material, or anything abstract.
- Kanyini (connection) was broken
	- Forced out of Ngura (land); walytja (family) is split (animals and stuff)
