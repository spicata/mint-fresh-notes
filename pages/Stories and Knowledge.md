Stories downt act as a form of knowledge, but rather a medium of which this knolwedge is spread.

Stories add a context to information as it does wbechich adds a gret impact to. Contextul clues are a crucial part of information retaention. It not only helps with the recalling of knoledge but also with the application of said information. There is definite research on the impact of context in information retention. Two key examples would be Luhmann's zettelkasten and the Yunkapoorta Aboriginal pedogagy. WiThin the Zettelkasten, ideas are linked to gether to add a context in which the idea makes sense. This is what allowed Luhmann to become what of the most instustriou wirters of the time. By adding a context, it allowed the same information to take on different aspects in doffent contexts. THe yunkappoorta article also emphasises the need for context in information. Without this context, there can be no meaning to the information.

The yunkapoorta article als hihglights another benefit with storyftelling as a way of trasmitting information; storys are engaging. It also allows the audience to empathise with the characters within the sotry. This is a key reason that these stories exist in western and eastern philosophys and societies as well, such as aesop's fables and allegorys.The use of characters can help convey meaningul ideas and lessons for life.

Stories also act as a medium where people can share their own personal experiences to each other. It allows socieities and peples to not only benefit from their own expereinces, but the exeriences of those areound them as well. To add to that, oral stories are much more exporsed to this kind of exeperience-sharing, as they do not stay fixed. Rather, oral stories are dynamic and everchanigng.
