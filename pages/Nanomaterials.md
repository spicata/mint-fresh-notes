Nanomaterials are materials that are composed of structures that exist on the nanometre scale (see also: [[Materials]]). Because the square-cube law is funny ([[Square-Cube Law is Funny]]), nanomaterials act weirdly. Ever seen a gecko? Know how they stick to stuff? Yeah, they have nanomaterial feet.

We can also make nanomaterials. A common one is fullerenes, and carbon nanotubes, and graphene. I donâ€™t know what they are used for yet ðŸ˜• .
