If the liquids homogenise[^1], you can use distillation to separate it. What’s distillation? You evaporate a liquid, then condense it and collect it somewhere else[^2]. Liquids usually have different boiling temperatures, so it’s useful. You can also do this to get liquid back from solutions. Say you dropped some salt in your orange juice. You don’t want salty orange juice, so you distil the orange juice/salt solution, and get your orange juice back.

If they are immiscible, you can use a separation funnel to separate, albeit carefully, the liquids based on density.

[^1]: Liquids that become a homogeneous mixture are called miscible liquids.
[^2]: What the difference between distillation and evaporation? It’s that distillation condenses the liquid again, allowing it the be collected. For evaporation, it just becomes part of the atmosphere (or the venting system).
