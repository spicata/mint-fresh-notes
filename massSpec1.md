mass spectrometry is a way that we are able to measure the mass to charge ratio of atoms, and thus allows us to measure the concentrations of certain isotopes of an element in a sample. mass spectrometry has 5 steps:

1. vaporisation
1. ionisation
1. acceleration
1. deflection
1. detection

a sample must enter the mass spectrometer in a gaseous state, and this means that the sample is first vaporised. then the sample is bombarded by a high-power electron gun, ionising the atoms into cation. then the electron is accelerated by electromagnetic fields between charged plates, which sends the ion down the spectrometer, which then is deflected by magnets in the spectrometer. heavier atoms are deflected less, whilst more positively charged atoms are deflected more, which may sometimes collide into the side of the spectrometer. at the end of the spectrometer, there is detector which can detect an atom's mass and charge, as well as the number of atoms that share this mass and charge.
