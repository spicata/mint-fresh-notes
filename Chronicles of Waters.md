## 02nd of February, 2023

- We talked about some "important" stuff.
- Graphing is weighted a lot. It's also a pain in the neck, and bio is cringe.
- Bad graphs, and big graph no-no's:
    - Doesn't need to go through origin
    - Don't extrapolate data
    - Don't use points to calculate gradient.
- We live in a physical world.
- Distracted study is worse than no study. Do not use your phone when studying. Turn off notifications or put it in a different room. "I hate calls >:-("
- Physics is the easiest science. It's literally just addition, subtraction, multiplication, and the other one. And it's all on the formula sheet anyways.
- Rote memorisation is okay to do. We rote memorised the alphabet after all.
- If you are sick, please don't come to school. I don't want whatever you have. Covid exists. Also, "something something 'pond scum' something"
- Just try your best

## 06th of February, 2023

- Went over daily notices. Check them if you want. Or not if you don't.
- Covid is still going around. Enjoy life while you can. Try not to die.
- He shaved his beard (not in class but ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯).
- We looked at [[Error]] and uncertainty. Why? Well real-life measurements can never be completely true. Even if we got an extremely accurate ruler, atoms will always jiggle around, so good luck actually getting the "true" value.
    - Most of the time, this is good enough. If we're going to be realistic, "close enough" is good most of the time.
- This stuff is apparently worth a lot of marks over time.
    - Once Year 12 got bozo'd by an ENU[^1] question
    - This is cause WACE can just give what is essentially an extension question in the exams :-).
    - Also, ENU is the only thing not on the formula sheet, so learn this crap.
- Mentioned absolute vs percentage errors.
- Only time we can remove measurement error is with an absolute zero ruler.
    - Although, this effect is negligible
- [[Four Measures of Correctness]] is actually pain. But we need this cause science in empirical... sometimes.
    - Even 9.80m/s/s for gravity was figured out empirically. 
- Something about fungus gene knockout that took 123 tries and researchers giving each other kisses. Also amino acids.
- Something about *Breaking Bad* and volumetric glass, and something about Waters' son wanting to do a Mista White.
- As long as the true values fall within your error range, that experiment is accurate. If it doesn't, then it is inaccurate.
- ChatGPT is unreliable, but can give you hints I guess. Waters is hopeful for the future; maybe ChatGPT can become like Wikipedia.

- Write reports in Year 12. If you give it in early, Dr Waters'll mark and give 'em back.
    - Remember to explain and elaborate in these reports. Saying something like "lolbeans precision goes down" doesn't cut it.
- Absolute uncertainty (AU) are plus-minus 0.5 of the smallest unit on the tool you are using.
    - e.g. 121 +- 0.5mm
- Percentage uncertainty (%U) is plus minus the (AU over measurement times 100) $\frac{AU}{measurement}\cdot100\%$. 
- **Hey!** Dr Waters reminded us that, even if you listen, if you don't take notes, that's like 0% recall.
- Aliens and lasers are probably also inaccurate.
- 3 sig. fig usually works.
- As the length goes up, the %U goes down.
- Doesn't care about hats in classrooms. Maybe you have a cold head... or it's a fashion statement. Who know?
- Lower %U is more precise.
- Of course, to make it "accurate", you can increase the error bars, but that's "fudging the books".
- Random error is better than systematic. With one, you keep the general centre of attention the same. With the other, the focus shifts.
- If you ever need uncertainty arithmetic:
    - If you are adding, add the AU's
    - If you are multiplying, add the %U
- Rounding is bad, cause it accumulates.

- Bring STAWA next lesson and read 14.1. We are doing some vectors practical. This will also require your phone as a compass, but don't only look at you phone, as you will hit something.
- Also, since we will be in groups, it's okay if everyone takes a different time. 
- Sometimes, textbooks and teachers will not put direction for vectors. Please do. Be better than your mentor.
- Here are some scalar and vector units:

| **>>** | **Scalar** | **<<** | **>>** | **Vector** | **<<** |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| *Name* | *Variable* | *Unit* | *Name* | *Variable* | *Unit* |
| Distance | s | m | Displacement | s (or h) | m |
| Speed | v=s/t | m/s | Velocity | v=s/t | m/s |
| | | | Acceleration | a=v/t | m/s/s |
| | | | Force | F=ma | N |
| Work | W=Fs | J | | | |
| Kinetic Energy | Ek=(1mv^2)/2[^2] | J | | | |
| Potential Energy | Ep=mgh | J | | | |
| Temperature | | °K | | | |
| Time | t | s | | | |


- You can express some units as other units. For example, N(ewtons) = kgm/s/s
- Vectors are not equal to free body diagrams.
  ![[VectorvsFreeBody.png]]
- Vectors use only vector quantities, they are resolved (draw the resultant), they need arrows, and it's usually head-to-tail.
- Free body only shows real forces in action.
- Gravity = Fg or W or Fw.
- The chronicles of Blob and Blab.
- Something about planes looking like donkeys.
- The tale of monkeys, peanuts, and elephants.

## 9th of February, 2023

- We did the graphing vector experiment (STAWA 14.1)
- That's it essentially.

## 13th of February, 2023

- Went through daily notices, swimming carnival of Week 4 Monday (next week).
- Something about Ireland (26+6=1).
- When Dr Water says next Wednesday, he means the "next coming Wednesday", not "next week's Wednesday".
- Learnt some [[Vector Diagram Tips]]
- Return of Blob
- Don't do quadratic equations. Something goes in, something comes out. We don't know where it might go wrong.
- I think Waters has a pptx that he uses himself.
- Don't waste his limited time by using true bearing in physics. That's saved for maths.
- Doesn't like the Beatles.
