# Philosophy Argument

> [!TODO] Aboriginal Dreaming stories focus on the virtue of treating nature as beings with an end, and the vice of treating them as a means ([13 - Kantian](13%20-%20Kantian.md), [15 - Virtue Ethics](15%20-%20Virtue%20Ethics.md)). 
> - Kanyini schema as an Aboriginal moral point of view [Kanyini](Kanyini.md)
> - Maslow’s Hierarchy as a theoretical model of human nature and human motivation ([Maslow's Hierarchy](Maslow's%20Hierarchy.md), [Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs 2](Maslow's%20Hierarchy%20of%20Needs%202.md), [14 - Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs](14%20-%20Maslow's%20Hierarchy%20of%20Needs.md))
> - The theory of at least one philosopher we have looked at ([Epicurus (L)](Epicurus%20(L).md), [Sartre](Sartre.md), [13 - Kantian](13%20-%20Kantian.md))

## What I need to research:

- Maslow’s hierarchy of needs,
- Sartre’s philosophy,
- Kanyini schema, and
- how to write philosophical arguments.
