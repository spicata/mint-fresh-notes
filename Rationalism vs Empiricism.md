Plato and Aristotle made a 2000 year argument. Plato reasoned that everything is a mere representation (a “shadow”) of its true form. This true form can only be understood through reason. Aristotle, Plato’s student, didn’t deny the existence of a true form, but believed that people could only become aware of it through experience ([[Aristotle's Good]]). Their ideals survived much longer than they did, appearing within the debates of Rationalism and Empiricism throughout the years ([[Empiricism]]).
