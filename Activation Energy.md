Activation energy is the amount of energy needed to make a reaction happen. This idea was brought to you by Svante Arrhenius. What exactly happens when activation energy is achieved?

Well, molecules semi-break their bonds and semi-makes new ones. This is an activated complex. From here on, it can fall both ways. Unbreak their bonds, or make new ones.
