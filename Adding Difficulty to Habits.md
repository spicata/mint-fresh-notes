If we can make good habits easier to make it more frequent, we should make bad habits harder ([[Activation Energy and Habits]]). An easy way is to make it impractical and unwieldy. To do this however, it is important to change before, not after, as cravings make change difficult. This is essentially a Ulysses pact[^1].
