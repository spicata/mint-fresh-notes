Oxidation states shows the loss or the gain of electrons for oxidants and reductants. So yeah, uh... here are the rules I guess:

1. Oxygen (usually) has an oxidation state[^1] of -2
1. Hydrogen has an o.s of +1
1. Free elements[^2] have an o.s of nil
1. Ions have an o.s equal to their charge

Some elements have a variable o.s because yes.

Also, halogen have an o.s of -1 in ionic molecules, but have an o.s of +1 or +7.

[^1]: I'm just going to call it o.s now
[^2]: The ones that exist on its own. Like, by itself. For example, noble gases.
