The shell model was an electron configuration[^1] model by Niels Bohr[^2]. It hypothesised that electrons were arranged in “shells” or energy levels, and electrons would try to stay in these shells.

These shells are able to hold only a certain amount of electrons. The first shell (closest to the nucleus) can hold 2, then the next one can hold 8, then 16, then 32[^4]. 

These electrons can also be expressed in a notation. It’s easier to explain with an example. Magnesium has 12 electrons in total. It has 2 in its K shell, 8 in the L shell, and 2 in the M shell. So, it can be expressed as 2,8,2.

[^1]: Fancy way of saying “where the electrons are”.
[^2]: Made in 1913
[^3]: He did not say that.
[^4]: The first shell is known as the K shell, the next one out is the L shell, and so on. KLMN
