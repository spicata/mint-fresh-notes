An good example of a [[Catalyst]] is in the Haber process in making ammonia.

$$N_{2 (g)}+3H_{2 (g)}\rightleftharpoons 2NH_{3 (g)}$$

Making ammonia like that is good and all, but it isn't that fast, and so it isn't profitable. We need to make it faster. Haber came along and said "hmmm catalyst", and used iron as a catalyst. Then process became faster, we make ammonia.

All is well.
