Remember to take meaningful breaks during studying. It reduces stress, lifts mod, rests the brain, and will increase your productivity in the future ([[Mood and Study]]). A short break goes a long way. Try not to study for over an hour at a time[^1]. Also, a meaningful break should be relaxing ([[To do on Break]]). But never use your phone on breaks. Phones are mentally taxing, and can degrade the quality of your work afterwards.
