You know why using a mechanical keyboard is so fun? Because it is clicky. And noisy. And mainly noisy. By typing you get instant feedback with a satisfying feel and noise. Who doesnâ€™t love the click[^1]?

It works because humans are monkeys. Sensory stimulation is good, and we like feedback for actions. Specifically immediate returns. Humans love them.

Our brains priorities immediacy. However, we manipulate this to reinforce our actions. If we are able to attach short-term benefits to a thing that pays of in the long-term, our monkey brain and our brain brain will work together to accomplish it (see also: [[Planning into the Future]]).
