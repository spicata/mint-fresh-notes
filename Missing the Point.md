Missing the point is an idiom, and [[Simplicity is Good]], but I think this idiom is a pretty clear one. It means that you have not understood what the most important part of something is. And we do this all the time:

- Point of a court: protect people from misunderstanding and other oversights.

    Not: serve as a platform for the guilty to get away.
- Point of a school: educate children and create an environment that allows people to learn.

    Not: get good grades in a standardised test.
- Point of money: an easy standardised medium to exchange goods.

    Not: collect literally all of it you can.

Why people miss the point so often? I don't know the answer. I used the middle one as an example of [[Goodhart's Law]], that might be a reason.
