## 02nd of February, 2023

- We just practised 

## 03th of February, 2023

- Practised more, Lucarelli Chem Set 2 and 5.

## 07th of February, 2023

- We did a pre-test :-O. I guess we'll see results next time around.

## 8th of February, 2023

- Today was a very content heavy lesson.
- We did [[History of the Atom]]. I dislike history but :-/.
    - I'll run through it briefly. Some ancient Greeks guessed that there are indivisible particles that make everything. They called this the atomos.
    - [[John Dalton]] found the atom.
    - [[JJ Thomson]] found the electron.
    - [[Ernest Rutherford]] found the nucleus and the proton.
    - [[Niels Bohr]] made the planetary model.
    - Heisenberg made the quantum model, which is based on probability.
- Modern science, unlike ancient philosophy, has the special quality of standing on the shoulders of giants.
- Atoms are "the basic building blocks of matter"
- We looked at [[Atomic Forces]].
- Why don't electrons suicide into the nucleus? Well some funky quantum stuff.

## 9th of February, 2023

- Reviewed [[History of the Atom]].
- Looked at the structure of the atom.
- Atomic (proton) number is Z, and mass number is A.
- Isotopes are atoms of the same elements that have different numbers of neutrons, meaning that their A is different. Think the difference between carbon-12 and carbon-13 (and carbon-14).
- Isotopes have different physical properties.
- Looked into [[Mass Spectrometer]]s.
- This shows you what is in a sample.
- To practice, check the PPT.

## 10th of February, 2023

- Empty class at start :-/
- STAWA Sets 8 and 21 is what we did. As **homework** I shall mark.
- That's it

## 14th of February, 2023

- Homework: STAWA Set 23 and (i think) 26
- Balancing equations: law of conservation of mass at work.
- Stoichiometry
