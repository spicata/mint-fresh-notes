Cues are the most important part of habits ([[Habits]]). To make or break habits, you need to target cues. To make a good habit, establish a cue, and do your habit accordingly. It will take effort at first, but it will become less over time ([[Tips of Habits]]). To break a bad habit, find the cue, and be aware of it. If that cue ceases to exist, it will be easier to break your habit.
