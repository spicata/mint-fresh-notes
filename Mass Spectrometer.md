Mass spectrometer is an analytical tool you use to analyse relative isotopic mass of your sample, which you can use to find the relative atomic mass of an element. You can use this for C-14 dating, for forensics, and for space exploration. This is how it works:

1. Vaporisation.
   
   The sample must enter as a vapour for the mass spectrometer to work. You can do this by melting/boiling your sample if it not in a gaseous state. Then it is put into the mass spectrometer.

1. Ionisation.
   
   Electrons are knocked out of an atom's influence by a high energy electron gun, ionising the atoms into a cation. This allows deflection to take effect.

1. Acceleration.
   
   Electromagnetic fields between charged plates accelerate the ionised atoms from the previous step, sending it down the mass spectrometer.

1. Deflection.
   
   A magnetic field deflects the course of the ions. Lighter atoms are deflected more, while heavier atoms are deflected less.

1. Detection.
   
   A sensor at the end of a mass spectrometer measures the mass, charge, and number of ions.
