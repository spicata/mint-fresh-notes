Covalent bonding is a form of chemical bonding that happens between non-metals, in which atoms share pairs of electrons with each other. If this occurs between two atoms (or more) of the same non-metal, then we have non-polar bonding, as the electronegativity of both atoms are equal. For example:

![[Oxygen.png]]

is a form of non-polar bonding, as the two oxygen atoms have the same electronegativity, thus sharing the electrons equally. What nice fellows. There are other times when it isnâ€™t so nice. When the two atoms have different electronegativities, then the electron is more inclined to lean one way.[^1] For example:

![[Hydroxide.png]]

is a form of polar bonding. The electrons lean more towards the oxygen, and hence the oxygen is relatively negative, while the hydrogen is relatively positive.

[^1]: Specifically, towards the atom with a higher electronegativity.
