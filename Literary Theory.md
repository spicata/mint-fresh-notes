Literary theory seems intimidating at first, because some people don't think that [[Simplicity is Good]]. Don't be put off. Literary criticism is the analysis of texts, and literary theory is the idea of analysing texts. What do I mean by that? Think of it this way.

[[Literary Critic]] A said that text B meant this, then wrote an essay about it. That essay is the literary criticism of text B. Literary theory is the way that critic A thought. It is their *perspective*; the way they see the world. What made them think text B meant this. Some literary theories go [[Hand in Hand (Literary Theory)]] with some texts, and those critics are able to go [[With the Grain (Literary Theory)]]. Lucky :-/.

Oh yeah, don't confuse these with literary movements. Literary theory is how people think of texts, literary movements are how people wrote them.
