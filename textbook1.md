## the development of the atom

- Dalton (1808) thought of the atom
    - Atom = indivisible
    - Different elements = different type of atoms
    - Based on experimental observation[^1]
- Thomson (1897) discovered the electron
    - Through cathode ray tubes
        - Produces cathode ray
    - Magnets to measure the cathode ray
        - Lighter than hydrogen atom
        - Same in all atoms
    - Electrons = subatomic in all atoms
    - Atoms = electrons + positively charged complex
        - Plum pudding
- Rutherford (1910) found the nucleus
    - Used gold-foil experiment
        - Alpha particles --> gold foil
        - Detected by fluorescent screen
    - Alpha particles deflected greatly (unexpected)
    - Mass + charge concentrated in middle?
    - Rutherford model (planetary model)
- Bohr (1913) electrons = shells
    - Discrete energy levels 
    - Based off hydrogen emission spectra
- Chadwick (1932) found neutron
    - Based of Rutherford, 1920 -> proton
    - Rutherford's model was wrong in mass
    - Chadwick discovered the neutron

## aas

- Element identified
- Cathode lamp is made
- Light shone through a vaporised sample
    - The element that can absorb absorbs.
    - The rest don't
- Focused through a slit in the monochromator
- Detected by detector
- The degree of the absorbance is the absorbance value. (inverse to light left)
- Plotted against calibration curve (absorbance value with concetration)
- Concentration is determined

## aes

- light refracted by a prism
- Longer is refracted less
- Goes through a monochromator
- Detected.

dalton (1808) hypothesised the existence of a indivisible particle that made up all matter. this is the atom. he thought that each chemical element had a different type of atom. unlike democritus and leucippus, his ideas were based on experimental observation. 

thomson (1897) then used
