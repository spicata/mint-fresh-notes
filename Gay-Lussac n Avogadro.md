Gay-Lussac’s law in a nutshell (worded badly): x amount of gas 1 and y amount of gas 2 becomes z amount of gas 3, and x:y:z is a simple, whole-number ratio. But then…

Avogadro’s[^1] law is that for two equal volumes, there are equal number of molecules. Nothing revolutionary now, but imagine you are a scientist during late 1700s or early 1800s and you don’t know anything about molecules, because no-one knows about them, and then a person with a 67 letter long name appears and says there is something with a neutral charge and made of more than one atoms.

[^1]: Lorenzo Romano Amedeo Carlo Avogadro, Count of Quaregna and Cerreto is a bopping name
