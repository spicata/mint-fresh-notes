Humans can store ridiculous amounts of data[^1] in our brain, its just that we are kind of crap at recalling information. Once a habit is formed, good luck forgetting it. You won’t be able to. However, we can change our environment so that the cues to the habits never come up. This is why controlling our environment is priority number one ([[Environments and Habits]]). That way, we can make our cues “invisible”.
