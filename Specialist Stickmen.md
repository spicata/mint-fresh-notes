- [[Proof]]s are fun. It means different thing in different contexts, but cause math is pure, it just comes down to thinking. You don't need evidence or whatever.
- Math is the superior subject.
- Difference between [[Proof vs Evidence]]
- Had a look at Goldbach's conjecture
- Is this really necessary? Yes.
- Other than theorems, we have [[Axiom]]s.
- We play with theorem lego.
- Some theorems are looong.
- Here is how to succeed:
    - Focus in class, regularly review, try to keep up with the class, do past exams, and ask for help.

- An example of a proof. It was a proof that he co-authored. It was too complicated for us to really understand. I just listened because he seemed happy explaining it.
- A lemma is a little theorem.
- We look a bit into different [[Proof Types]]
- Started looking at [[Set]]s, including the special (black-board) ones. Apparently $\mathbb{Z}$ stands for something in German.
- [[Irrational Number]]s are plenty. We also played some number line dart, and we came back to the infinite hotel again.
- Also looked at [[Set Notation]].
- Conditional statements are "if ... then ..." statements. We also sometimes use the $\implies$ symbol. We're not proving if the "if" is true, we're just looking at the relationship.
    - We assume that "if" is true.
- We also use QED.

## 06th of February, 2023

- Here are some proof principles:
    - Proofs should be precise and unambiguous.
    - You should be able to replace the symbols are read it out. Use linking words like you do in English
    - Statements are either true, or they instruct the reader to do something/notice something/anything else I guess.
    - Written in first person plural. We are on a journey to the truth.
- In short: like an IKEA manual.
- There are some common mistakes. Here's how to fix it:
    - Variables are constant. That is to say, don't use one variable to define two different things >:-(. This is because you want to...
    - Make sure it is general. It should apply to all case possible within the limits of the question.
    - If you can't find a direction, just suppose that this happens, and try all the different possibilities. This is exhaustion.
    - DON'T ASSUME THAT THE STATEMENT IS TRUE. This was so bad that Dr Pearce drew this (imitation):  
      ![[Angry Pearce.png]]
    - Write rough wok when stuck.
- Pearce got jumpscared by smartboard options.
- We did Exercise 6A. If you didn't finish it, it's homework.
    - Got stuck on 18 :-/

## 7th of February, 2023

- Sometimes, we get an if-then-question, but don't know what to do. This usually happens if the then-part is longer than the if-part. If this is the case, we can use **proof by contrapositive**.
- There are many ways to find the "opposite" of a statement
    - Negation: if A then B --> if A then not B
        - This looks for "the rest", not the opposite. For example, not-greater is smaller-or-equal-to.
    - Inverse: if A then B --> if B then A
    - Converse: if A then B --> if not A then not B
    - Contrapositive: if A then B --> if not B then not A
        - This is the only one that is true.
- When doing not's, we need to keep in mind *De Morgan's law*:
    - not(A and B) = not A or not B
    - not(A or B) = not A and not B
- Homework: Ex6B (all)

## 9th of February, 2023

- Please get the new Cambridge book please. It has different stuff.
- If the converse (see above) is also true, then A and B are equivalent.
    - A <=> B (or A if and only if B, which is shortened to A iff B)
- We went into the linguistics of "if and only if"
- A <=> B is the proved by A => B & B => A.
- Another way is P <=> R <=> Q. It is also possible to take different routes, such as P => R => Q, Q => S => P
- Combi won't be in the test.
- Quote of the day: "feature of english language"
- (Homework) Did 6C (6B if not finished). We are going quick, but please try to keep up.

## 10th of February, 2023

- Looked at [[Quantifiers]], and [[Proving with Quantifiers]].
- Confused Pearce?
- Did 6D (6C if not finished), do for homework.


## 13th of February, 2023

- We are gonna be finishing proofs soon.
- We looked at [[Proof by Contradiction]]. Examples are:
    - Proof of infinite primes
    - Proof of square root of 2 irrationality.
- Ex13a (Homework)

## 14th of February, 2023

- Homework: Anything you haven't finished from Chapter 6 and 13
- Recurring decimals are rational.
- Interval notation.
