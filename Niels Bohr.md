Bohr in 1913 used math to realise that electrons were organised into shells. He based this off of Frank Hertz's experiments. These shells would only contain a certain number of electrons, and the electrons could not exist between different shells. The electrons can also move between shells, emitting energy as it moves down in the form of heat and light, and absorbs energy as it moves up a shell.
