Hi there! I'm M.spicata, and I am an amateur researcher who just likes doing stuff on the web. I make notes, and also sometimes other resources. I made mint fresh notes just as a platform to host these notes, albeit brokenly. I also made the [Notes Coalition]((https://notes-coalition.github.io/)) (I think).

## Why do I do this?

First of all, I like to learn what I find interesting. And so, I make lots of notes. But also, I think information should be free. Education should be free. Why? Well, information and education benefits everyone. Some information is useful (sciences), and others are just for fun (arts (math) ). Both are good, and both benefits humanity. Keeping information to yourself is kind of just selfish.

## Talk to me

I don’t use Reddit, Twitter, Facebook, etc. You can always send me an email at [pixelandian@gmail.com](mailto:pixelandian@gmail.com), or you can message me on Discord (Mspicata#9966), although I’m a little less active than usual nowadays.
