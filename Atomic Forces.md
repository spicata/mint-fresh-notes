The atomic forces that exist on the atomic scale are the: strong nuclear force, electrostatic attraction, and electrostatic repulsion. Electrostatic attraction happens between the nucleus and the electron, because opposite's attract. This law is known as Coulomb's law. Of course, the closer the electron, the stronger the attraction.

Electrostatic repulsion happens between all of the protons in a nucleus. Why doesn't nucleus just explode? Because of...

Strong nuclear force, which keeps an atom together. You don't need to know how it works, but ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯.
