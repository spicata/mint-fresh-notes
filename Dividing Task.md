Dividing tasks allows for organisation, satisfaction, and manageability. Doing so can creates a clearer view of the project ([[How to Divide Tasks]]). The tasks can be adaptable, however, there should be at least 3 planned tasks. Split up tasks are easier to achieve, making the entire project seem manageable, and completion of parts bring satisfaction thatâ€™ll keep you going. It should create intrinsic value ([[Intrinsic Value]]).
