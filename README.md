# mint fresh notes :-)

Hi! I'm Spicata Mentha, stylised M.spicata. I makes a whole bunch of notes, so I thought it would be nice to post them here on GitHub, and also on my website. It's always better to leave a path through the jungle of the internet. Even better if you can leave a paved path.

They aren't the best of notes, but as long as one single person finds one single note useful, its goal is accomplished.

Of course, you can always refer to the website, but they store my actual finished, published stuff. Which is (currently) zero.

The other thing you can do is copy this repository. You'll have to download git. But you are on Github, so I'll assume you have. 

Open your terminal where you want to clone it. Then you can type either:

- `git clone https://github.com/spicata/mint-fresh-notes.git`, or
- `git clone git@github.com:spicata/mint-fresh-notes.git`

And then wait a bit. This will let you see my unpublished notes. My admittedly not so great ones :-/. Every once in a while, remember to `git pull` to get the latest notes.

Oh, by the way. I am not a company, and I am making no profit. That would be dumb. I am simple an individual writing notes.
