“mint fresh notes” are my notes. Previously found at [mint-garden](https://mint-garden.netlify.app/), now at [mint fresh notes](https://spicata.github.io/mint-fresh-notes/). [Check the GitHub if you want!](https://github.com/spicata/mint-fresh-notes)

This website is hosted by GitHub pages and made through Jekyll & [no-styles-please](https://riggraz.dev/no-style-please/). The font used is Garamond.

Sorry for an inconvenience, but links may be broken as I migrate to WikiLinks. Hopefully, Mace (from Mace’s Notes) will be able to fix it soon.
