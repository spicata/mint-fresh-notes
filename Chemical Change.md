Chemical changes are changes that happen to molecules. It tends to be a whole lot more permanent than physical changes, and also tend to:

1. form a substance,[^2]
1. cause significant temperature change,
1. create light and sound,
1. cause a colour change, &
1. give off an odour[^1]

[^1]: Realistically speaking, you honestly shouldn't be smelling the products of chemical reactions.
[^2]: Gases evolve, precipitates form.
