Sometimes, some [[Literary Theory]]s are very good for analysing certain texts. For example (and this is a guess), a feminist theory would probably be good to analyse *Pride and Prejudice* (i think, i haven't read it). Or you could use a psychoanalytical theory to study *The Mysterious Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde*. These go hand in hand, which is very useful for us.
