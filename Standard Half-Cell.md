You know, if we want to make a meaningful measurement, we should set an agreed upon standard. This is why I hate the imperial system, as there is no agreed upon standard. A foot length is different for everyone.

Anyways, we need a standard for galv cells too. A standard half-cell is a platinum electrode covered in hydrogen gas bubbles, submerged in a hydrogen electrolyte.
