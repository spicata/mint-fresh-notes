You know, if we want to make a meaningful measurement, we should set an agreed upon standard. This is why I hate the imperial system, as there is no agreed upon standard. A foot length is different for everyone.

Anyways, we need a standard for galv cells too. A standard half-cell is a platinum electrode covered in hydrogen gas bubbles, submerged in a hydrogen electrolyte. (At [[Standard Condition]] that is)

"Wait what? Why do we do this?" Well, it's because hydrogen is a funny element. Let's use an [[Ionic Half Equation]] to show you why. 

$$2H^{+}+2e^{-}\rightleftharpoons H_{2}$$

This is the ionic half equation of hydrogen. It produces 0.00 V. So nothing really changes. This means that, depending on the other-half cell, the standard half-cell can either be the oxidation cell or the reduction cell. Also, since it produces nada, the volts of energy passing through the voltmeter connected to the conductive stuff (see [[Galvanic Cells]] if you don't remember the conductive stuff) is all from the other half-cell.
