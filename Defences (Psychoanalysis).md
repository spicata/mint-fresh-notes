How do we keep the bad stuff in the warehouse? Here are just a few ways. You can:

- Only select the memories and details you want to keep
- Deny any bad stuff happened
- Avoid things that remind you of it
- Take out your anger on an innocent bystander (don't shoot the messenger)
- Relive it as an attempt to change it
