Rate of reaction (or reaction rate) is self-explanatory. Temperature, concentration, gas pressure, and surface area/particle size all influence the reaction rate. Why? Well first go learn [[Collision Theory]].

In chem, hotter means faster, and so temperature increases reaction rate. Concentration and gas pressure means more things in less space, and that increases collisions.

Think of it this way. Let's say we put 10 kids in a classroom. They get to move around a bunch, but they probably will avoid each other. Now let's cram 100 kids in a classroom. They will bump into each other a whole lot more.

Surface area/particle size also increase collisions. This'll need a diagram

If we cut it in half (imagine they have the same area), then there is red amount more perimeter. Collisions only happen on the perimeter. So more perimeter is better.

By the way, this is called chemical kinetics (I think ðŸ«¤)
