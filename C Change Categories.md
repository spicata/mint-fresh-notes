There are a lot of different types of chemical changes (see [[Chemical Change]]). Synthesis makes a few simple things into one complex thing, and decomposition does the exact opposite. However, most of the time, decomposition needs some energy input, otherwise, what stops our universe from just decomposing entirely. This can be thermal, photolytic (light), or electrolytic. Coolbeans.

There is also combustion, which involves oxygen and heat. It can produce carbon dioxide (bad) or carbon monoxide (also bad). Also neutralisation equations. You can add acid to a base and get a salt, or react acids with carbonates.

Finally, precipitation reactions, form a precipitate (see also [[Chemical Change]])
