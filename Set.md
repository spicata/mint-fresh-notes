Sets are collections of stuff. We use curly brackets for them... like this: {1,2,3}. There are some special sets that we use:

1. $\mathbb{R}$eal, any number that is on our number line.
2. $\mathbb{Q}$ = rational, any real number that you can show as a fraction.
3. $\mathbb{Z}$ = integers, any (you know) rational number that is whole.
4. $\mathbb{N}$atural, any integers above 0.
