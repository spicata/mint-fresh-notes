Imagine you live without modern technology[^1] and there is food that contains toxins. Now, you need to eat this food because otherwise you starve... so what do you do? Well, you can grind food and soak it in water to try to draw out the toxins, you can use heat to decompose the toxins (see [[C Change Categories]]), or ferment it using other organic things. All valid strategies.

Oh yeah by the way, the toxin we are talking about is cycasin, which is not only a neurotoxin, but it also gets broken down (by digestion) into a literal carcinogen, so yeah.

[^1]: I know for a fact that I wouldn't survive, and I'm pretty sure the average person wouldn't be able to either.
