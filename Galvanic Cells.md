Galvanic cells are electrochemical cells[^1] that produces electricity.

A is anode, B is anolyte, C is salt bridge, D is conductive stuff, E is cathode, F is catholyte, G is oxidation cell, H is reduction cell.

[^1]: Don't ask me what this is ðŸ¤«.

    I remembered what it was. Lo and behold, it was on my post it note. An electrochemical cell is a thing that turns chemical potential energy into electrical energy.

    Wait, if that's what an electrochemical cell is, what is a galvanic cell?
