Another thing about trying to negotiate based on stances (see [[Negotiating on Stances]]) is that your ego becomes all tangled up in your stance. Humans are highly personal beings, and we’ll take literally anything personally. If you tell me that my website is currently broken, then I’ll probably retaliate[^1]. 

So, I mean… let go. If it isn’t actually a personal attack and you are taking it that way, stop it and reevaluate.

[^1]: Not really. At this point, I’ll accept that Mace is incredibly lazy. Wait, frick I just retaliated.
