Bits and bytes are the two basic units of data storage. A bit is a single piece of information. A byte is 8 bits. They follow the SI unit prefixes. 1 bit is 1000 kilobits and so on. Within computers, a kilobit (and the rest) is often defined as 1024 bit. This has led to a discrepancy, which was corrected by adding another unit. The kilo binary bit, or the kibibit is 1024 bits.
