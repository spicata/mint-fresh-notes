Consistent habits are good habits. Things that you can repeat over and over and over. This is a reason why habits should be easy (see [[Activation Energy and Habits]]). It not only allows you to not be overwhelmed by it, but also lets you be consistent. Not much to it.

Also, we live in a world. Things come up every once in a while. We can sometimes miss our habits. Just donâ€™t miss twice. This creates the habits of not doing your habit. Not fun.
