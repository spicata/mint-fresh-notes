Let’s organise writing into 6 major stages or steps. The first 3 is what comes before writing: practising generally, practising specifically, and reading. To “practice generally” means to build foundational and overall writing skills. For example, practising brevity and proofreading other’s works. Of course, the most important tip is just to write lots. “Practising specifically” means to practice specific to the course. Reading is the last important bit. You can copy and imitate excerpts that you like, or break down ones that you think are interesting.
