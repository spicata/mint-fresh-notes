![[Periodic Table.png]]

This is close enough to what the periodic table actually looks like. (I) are the groups. The groups are the vertical columns that make up the table. For example, group 1 is the most left-most column, and it includes hydrogen, lithium, etc. There are 18 groups. (II) are the periods. These are the horizontal rows that make up the table. (III), in the unshaded area is what is called the “Main Group”. These 8 groups are important. In the shaded area, we have transition metals. Finally, in the doubly-shaded area, we have the lanthanides and the actinides (see also, [[Periodic Group Properties]]).
