Atoms can get excited too. When an atom becomes excited, one or more of its electrons moves up from the lowest possible energy state to a higher one (see [[Shell Model]]). This makes the atom unstable and have more energy. To become stable again, it undergoes emission, which releases the energy in the form of a photon. This can be seen in an emission spectrum, which shows us the wavelengths of the emitted photons for a certain element.
