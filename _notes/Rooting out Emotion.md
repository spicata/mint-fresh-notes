Humans are emotional beings. Emotions essentially dictate our every action (see also [[Emotions and Habits]]). But emotions can also sometimes blind us to reality. It is important to understand the emotions of not only ourselves, but also those around us. Find the root cause of why you feel an emotion. Why are you scared? Why are you angst ridden?

At times it has something to do with how something is conflicting with you identity/stance (see also [[Stances and Ego]], [[Contradiction Builds Character]], [[Contradiction Builds Character 2]]). People tend to feel uncomfortable when this happens.
