[[Romanticism]] was the reaction against classicism. This is a very common definition. It is also a very vague definition, which leads to the [[Problem with Romanticism]].

Some other ways that people saw was that Romanticism is the literature of the living, whilst the classicism was for the dead, or that romanticism was about chivalry.
