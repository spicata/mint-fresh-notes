Every particle has a different size. This is extremely useful when we want to separate them. **If** the particles are just solid, we can use a sieve to separate it based on the size of its particles. Larger particles get caught up, smaller particles make it through. **If** the particles are in an aqueous suspension, we can just spin it very fast[^1] to collect larger particles at the bottom[^2].

[^1]: Called centrifugation
[^2]: Wouldnâ€™t centrifugation be a form of separating based on density???
