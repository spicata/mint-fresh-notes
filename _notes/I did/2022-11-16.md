His solution to the problem of having two children to care for, was to find another woman to do the job

Within this extract, the author shows the disrespect and objectification of women to position readers to align their symapthises with women. It is stated that "his" solution to a problem was to "find another women to do the job", where another is used deliberatly, often connoting the replaceability of an object, to show the objectification of his lovers. The woman is also synecdochal of the entire population of women, showing the entrenched belief that women is something to be owned. However, this belief that humans can be treated as objects appears yet again in the case of the two children, who are seen as "the problem", which further emphasises the deeply rooted belief that men are simply superior beings that should be allowed to exert their power over anything and anyone. Finally, the passing on of a problem to another person as their 'duty' is highly problematic, and limits the autonomy of the other person.
