Let’s say we have $x=y$. To find if this is true, x and y need to have the same magnitude, the same direction (if it is a vector (see [[Vectors and Scalars]]) ), and they need to have the same unit. However, units themselves can’t tell us if x and y are equal. They are ambiguous. And so we need to make an equation using units. e.g. $\frac{m}{s}=m\div s$
