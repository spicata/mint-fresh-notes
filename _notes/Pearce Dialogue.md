- [[Proof]]s are fun. It means different thing in different contexts, but cause math is pure, it just comes down to thinking. You don't need evidence or whatever.
- Math is the superior subject.
- Difference between [[Proof vs Evidence]]
- Had a look at Goldbach's conjecture
- Is this really necessary? Yes.
- Other than theorems, we have [[Axiom]]s.
- We play with theorem lego.
- Some theorems are looong.
- Here is how to succeed:
    - Focus in class, regularly review, try to keep up with the class, do past exams, and ask for help.

- An example of a proof. It was a proof that he co-authored. It was too complicated for us to really understand. I just listened because he seemed happy explaining it.
- A lemma is a little theorem.
- We look a bit into different [[Proof Types]]
- Started looking at [[Set]]s, including the special (black-board) ones. Apparently $\mathbb{Z}$ stands for something in German.
- [[Irrational Number]]s are plenty. We also played some number line dart, and we came back to the infinite hotel again.
- Also looked at [[Set Notation]].
- Conditional statements are "if ... then ..." statements. We also sometimes use the $\implies$ symbol. We're not proving if the "if" is true, we're just looking at the relationship.
    - We assume it is "if" is true.
- We also use QED.
