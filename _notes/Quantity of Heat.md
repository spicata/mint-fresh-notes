Quantity of heat is the quantity of heat from a reaction. It is calculated by:

$$q=m\cdot C\cdot\Delta T$$

Wth are these variables? Well q is quantity of heat, m is mass (g), C is heat capacity, and delta T is change in temperature. What is heat capacity? The amount of energy it takes for something to get this much hotter. So yeah.

Does that mean that heat and temperature aren't the same thing?
