But that’s not why you are here. You are here to learn about the $6.022\times 10^{23}$ mole. Now that’s a real mole. That’s the cool mole. Well, the actual number is called Avogadro’s number. An Avogadro’s number of stuff is called a mole. But what is this number for exactly?

~~Well, when dealing with atoms and molecules, people like to use [[Relative Atomic Mass]], because it is simply easier to use “u” than it is to use “$1.661\times 10^{-24}$g”. A mole is essentially: Oh, there is a mole of carbon-12 (mass of 12u) in 12g. Basically, the conversion rate between relative atomic mass and grams. I think…~~

That is not what a mole is. A mole is just a measurement that chemists use for ease of access. What I found was a thing called “that’s what it is defined by you idiot”. The mole is defined as the amount of carbon-12 atoms in 12g. So yeah. Oops.
