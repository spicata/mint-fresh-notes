Core issues is the main problem [[sts]]. They can be things such as:

- fear of intimacy, because if we are emotionally distant, we don't get hurt
- fear of abandonment, what if they don't like me?
- fear of betrayal, what if my friends are using me.
- low self-esteem and insecurity, am I not good enough?
- [[Oedipus Complex]], which I call: "What the hell?"

Core issues are particularly sinister, because they end up forming our identity. And we like to [[Cling to Identity]]. 

Anxiety happens when [[Defences (Psychoanalysis)]] fail and the core issue is revealed. You have to confront reality. Usually this means changing, or erecting better defences.
