Most of us argue based on our stances. And we try to come to an agreement on our stances. Sadly, not everyone thinks like us. And so trying to create agreement based on your stance on the issue is bound to cause conflict. And to add to that, negotiating on your stances breaks down for many parties, and there is room for cooperation.

If it is unclear what I mean by negotiating on your stances, it can thought of like this. You believe this. The other person believes in that. Instead of trying to create a solution that both of you like, you try to make both of you have the same belief; either by getting the other person to think like you, or to become like them yourself.
