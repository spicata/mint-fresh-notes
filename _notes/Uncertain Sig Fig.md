In the real world, there is always possibility for uncertainty. And so we need to account for that. To do this, we add or take away 5 with order of magnitude of one smaller than the smallest power of ten (see [[Orders of Magnitude]]). For example, letâ€™s say I did an experiment and I measured 10.54. So then we have to do:

$$10.54\pm 0.005$$

Make sense? Hopefully. I might just be bad at explaining.
