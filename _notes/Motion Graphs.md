![[Motion graphs.png]]

Some motion graphs are the displacement-time graph (left) and the velocity-time graph (right). Both of the above graphs are depicting the same journey. Displacement-time graph shows the displacement of an object. The positive gradient line in the graph shows that the object is moving away. The straight line means it is at rest. The negative gradient shows that it is returning.

There is also the velocity-time graph, which shows the velocity of an object. Because it is moving away, the velocity is positive. When it is still the velocity is 0. When it is coming back, the velocity is negative.
