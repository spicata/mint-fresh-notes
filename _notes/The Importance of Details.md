Details are important. It’s pretty obvious. But even the smallest details can be important. What may not be important to you can be crucial for someone else. And if something thinks it’s important, don’t you agree that probably should be treated as such? And besides, if it is little for you but big for them, surely it isn’t much of a pain to solve their problem, eh (see also [[Asking Around]])?
