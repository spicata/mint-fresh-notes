I’m going to call this Postmack’s principle :*)* (see also: [[Premack's Principle]]). We can create something that indicates to us that we should do the habit before. Not as a cue, but as a turning point, where all the effort (craving) starts turns into action. It is the final push before action. This step can be very short and easy. In fact, it is better that way (see also: [[How to Divide Tasks]]). For example, walking out the door in the turning point. At this point, I may as well just walk outside.
