Atomic mass is a unit of measurement used to measure the weights of atoms, and subatomic particles. This is useful (in comparison to grams) because the atomic scale is so incredibly small that grams become unwieldy to use[^1]. 1 atomic mass (unit symbol is u) is defined as 1/12th of carbon-12. Using this, we can measure the mass of atoms.

Some element have more than one natural isotope. In that case, we see the frequency of each isotope in nature ([[Gravimetric Analysis]]???). Then we look at the mass of those isotopes. Using this, we find the average mass of the element. This is relative atomic mass, and is the little number on the periodic table.
