When faced with a problem, we like to explore possible solutions. Some are revealed to not work, others do. As we keep on facing this problem, our brain filters actions that don’t work. Instead, you do the actions that solve your problem. Over time, the mental effort required goes down and it becomes automatic[^1]. That’s a habit ([[Habits]]).
