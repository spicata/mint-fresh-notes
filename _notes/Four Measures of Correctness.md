There are 4 measures of "correctness": precision, accuracy, reliability, and validity. I'll quote this:

> [!QUOTE] Measures of correctness
> Precision: "the fineness of the scale on the instrument that is used to measure", **OR** "how close the trials for a particular part of our experiment are to each other". 
> 
> Accuracy: "How close the experimentally derived measurement is to its true value." This is taken as an average, usually.
> 
> Reliability: "If we repeat the experiment, the results are not significantly different from each other."
> 
> Validity: "No other variable is impacting on the independent or dependent variable."
