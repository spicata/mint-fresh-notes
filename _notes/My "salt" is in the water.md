**If** a solid is insoluble, you can use filtration[^1] to separate liquids and solids. Sand in water can be filtered. **If** a solid is soluble, then you can use evaporation if you want to just get the solids back. Did you accidentally drop the “salt” that Edward gave you into water? Well that’s okay, just heat it up to 100°C and you get it back!
