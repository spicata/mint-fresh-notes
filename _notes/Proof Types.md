There are different types of [[Proof]]s that you can use. Direct proofing is where you explain it directly through logic. Contradiction is when you show that if it wasn't true, it wouldn't make sense. Induction shows that for this starting point, it is true, and to go to the next case, it remains true. Exhaustion is showing that there is no other possibility.
