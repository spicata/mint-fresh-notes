If a substance has strong bonds, it has a rigid structure. If it has a rigid structure, that means itâ€™s constituents move less. If they move less, more energy can be put into the system before they break out. Bonds means structure, structure means high melting and boiling points. 

Ionic crystals have high melting points, and covalent networks have very high ones (see [[Crystals n Ionic Ones]] and [[Covalent Crystals]]). Covalent molecules have low melting points.
