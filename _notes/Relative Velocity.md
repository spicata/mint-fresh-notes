I run towards you at 20 metres per second[^1] and you run away at a velocity of 6 metres per second because you donâ€™t want to be anywhere near me[^2]. So then, my velocity in regard to you is 14 metres per second towards you. Relative velocity is the velocity of an object in comparison to the observer.

[^1]: I am faster than Usain Bolt >:*)*
[^2]: Fair enough
