[[Romanticism]] happened mainly in Germany, France, and England. It is seen as a reaction to neoclassicism (itself being the revival of classicism from Greece and Rome). The [[Problem with Romanticism]] is that it is kind of hard to define.

In England, Wordsworth and Coleridge are seen as the innovators of [[English Romanticism]]. They are responsible for the common [[Quality of Romanticism]].

[[Gothic]] literature is sometimes seen as a sort of precursor to romanticism.
