Humans are essentially monkeys with two feet and big brains. However, this heavily impacted how human history was formed. **First** of all, this meant our babies had to be born prematurely, meaning that it was harder to raise them. So, families had to put in more effort to actually keep an offspring alive. **Secondly**, we were able to use fire, which also meant that we were able to cook things. Very cool. **Thirdly**, we have freed our hands, meaning that we could use tools. Infinite growth! **Fourthly**, we had language.
