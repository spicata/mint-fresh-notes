Some atoms like to share their electrons, and others like to give them (away). Essentially, metals like to give away their own electrons. What good Samaritans. On the other hand, non-metals try to keep their electrons. However, they are also willing to come to a compromise and share their electrons with others (see [[Covalent Bonding]]). Still more responsible than most humans.
