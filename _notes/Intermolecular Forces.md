Intermolecular forces are forces that occur between forces ðŸ¤¯. There are three of them:

1. Dipole-dipole forces,
1. [[Dispersion Forces]], &
1. Hydrogen bonding

Dipole-dipole occur between polar molecules. Because of their dipoles, they are able to arrange themselves in structures, like what water does.
