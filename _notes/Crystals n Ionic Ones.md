Crystals are cool. Apparently there are 4 types of them. I didn’t know that. So there are ionic crystals, covalent network (crystals[^1]), covalent molecule (see [[Covalent Crystals]]), and metallic ([[Metallic Crystals]]).

Ionic crystals are formed from anions and cations arranged within a lattice[^2]. There is no mobile charge when it is solid, due to the strict arrangement of the ions, but when it is melted, this structure breaks down, allowing it to conduct electricity. It is hard and has a high melting point due to the strong attraction between the ions, but it is rather prone to shattering[^3] because a shift within the lattice creates repulsion between similarly charged ions.

[^1]: All of them are crystals, don’t make me repeat myself
[^2]: A geometric shape making up a crystal. Circular logic if you ask me.
[^3]: It’s brittle.
