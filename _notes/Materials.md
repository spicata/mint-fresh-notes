Materials are substances that are used to make objects.[^1] They have different physical and chemical properties. Pure substances maintain the same physical properties, although it depends on the structure[^2].

There are also compound materials, which use different classes of materials to cover for each other’s weaknesses.

[^1]: Although… what is an object? Is an atom an object? Are quarks materials? Don’t ask me, I don’t know.
[^2]: Like… coal and diamonds are made of the same thing (carbon), but they are very clearly different.
