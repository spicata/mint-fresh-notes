Walpole started [[Gothic]]-ism, which was continued by many writers, such as Radcliffe (apparently more rational) and Lewis (apparently more gruesome). Gothic literature got destroyed by gothic satire, but it came back during its second wave. Many romantic writers dipped their feet into gothic, such as [[John Keats]] and Byron. The Byronic hero was named after him, a stereotypical character found in both Gothic and Romantic literature.

Byron also hosted a ghosts & monsters competition, where many writers participated. Such as (Mary) Shelley, who ended up writing Frankenstein.
