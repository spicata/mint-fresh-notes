Good cues make effective habits ([[Habitual Cues]], [[Abusing Habit Anatomy]]). Good cues are obvious. Unmissable. Good cues are also unambiguous. There is no room for misinterpretation. Other habits are good and obvious cues. They should stand out in the environment. For example, a book on your bed would remind you to read before you sleep. That is a cue.
