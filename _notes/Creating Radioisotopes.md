Radioisotopes and other radioactive elements can be synthesised by using particle accelerators, such as linear accelerators and cyclotrons. Using these accelerators, humans have found out that we can collide certain atoms together to form heavier ones.

This is how we discovered and created transuranic elements[^1], and this is also how we commercially produce synthetic radioisotopes, such as those used in medical research.
