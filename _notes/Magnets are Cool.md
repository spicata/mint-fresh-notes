Iron and its friends (steel and others) are very magnetic, whereas copper and co are less magnetic. Others are just not magnetic at all. We can use this property to separate iron and friends from solid mixtures. Dropped your beloved iron shavings into the sandpit? Use a magnet to get them out. Very cool ðŸ˜Ž.
