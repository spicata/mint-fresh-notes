Neurons that fire together wire together[^1]. And so, cues, cravings, actions, and rewards become linked. But this linkage is based almost solely on frequency. And so, it is important to just do. Many times. Many good is better than little perfect ([[Just Do]]).

If you want to do lots, you need to make it easier to do ([[Activation Energy and Habits]]).
