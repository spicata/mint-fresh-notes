Metallic crystals form when some metal atoms get together, then decide that they are all like giving away their particles too much, so they create a collective “sea of electrons”, but then they realise that they are now positively charged, and thus is stuck to that sea. Because of this sea, electrons can move around easily, and thus they are conductive. 

Metals really just do be like that.
