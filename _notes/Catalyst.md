Catalysts are substances that act as a reaction pathway. That's not a very useful definition. A catalyst makes a reaction easier (this also happens to make it faster (see [[Rate of Reaction]]) ). It's reusable, which is always nice.

How does a catalyst make a reaction easier? Well, it lowers the [[Activation Energy]] required to actually undergo a reaction. How does it do this?

Catalysts are a one-stop-shop for electron sharing. It's a friendship bank.

Step 1, deposit your electron. You give your electron to the friendship bank. Step 2, while waiting for the electron to process, you wander around the bank and make a friend. Step 3, you withdraw you electron from the bank along with your friend, sharing it.
