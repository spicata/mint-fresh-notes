Redox is confusing. Redox is an acronym for reduction-oxidation (the actual order is the other way around, but no-one says oxred). What does reduction mean? Reduction means to gain electrons. Oxidation means to lose electrons.

Guess what you call things that oxidises. YOU CALL THE REDUCTANT. YOU CALL THE THING THAT *OXIDISES* A *REDUCTANT*. YOU CALL THE THING THAT REDUCES AN OXIDANT. WHAT? WHY?! ðŸ˜¡

This is the what's confusing about redox reactions. A reductant oxidises, and an oxidant reduces.
