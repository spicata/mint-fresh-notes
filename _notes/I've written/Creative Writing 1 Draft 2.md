Everything is coming to a close. My vision grows dim, as the world around me shrinks, slowly, slowly. The darkness inches its way into the room, uninvited; an unwelcome guest. It creeps around the corners, consuming the plastic-blue waiting chairs and the tables where my records lie; they disappear in the face of decay. The warm-orange lamp flickers, futility fighting the void, leaving me with the blinding whites and blues, which too will soon be eclipsed. Sounds grow dull and muffled, the crying and sobbing around me only ring as echoes of the past; there will only be silence. The silence of the end. Left drifting in space, nothing left to explore, nothing to see, nothing to hear. Barely alive and aware, conscious of the newly found melody, quietude.  

Only me and my thoughts now. if there only was more time… or less. Death waits patiently on the horizon, visible yet unreachable, as he teases me, leaving me to suffer. Even my thoughts, my only companion - my light in the dark - will slowly slip to the hands of time. Soon, it will be just me. Is this how it ends? Am I condemned to float here, alone and waiting? To remain even as my body and mind degrade, as everything I once knew, once loved, fades? My memories, my thoughts, my senses, my life.

I sigh. What use is it to struggle? Drifting in time and space, and empty nothingness except for the two bright lights that lie on opposite ends, looming out of reach. One glowing orange and yellow, flickering and shimmering. Flames dancing on it, full of life and energy. The other, glowing a blinding white, yet seems not to shine;, rather it remains constant and unmoving in the sky. Caught between both, unable to reach either.

Just waiting. Just waiting. Just waiting. Just waiting. Just waiting…

I close my eyes. In this solitude, what else can I do except find peace at the end. Where it is and where to look, I don’t know. I rummage through the past, everything I’ve experienced and felt. The deeper I fall, the more clear the sounds become, and my eyes now anew. A warmth surrounds me, as the bright, warm rays on my skin. Everything I've experienced , everything felt rushing back, as I fall into the comfortability of the past. My eyes remain closed. Soon the warmth falls away into the coolness of the white-blue light.
