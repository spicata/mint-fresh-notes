In literature, the constext of production has a profound intopact on the meaning of the text. This is exemplified in the death of as salesman by Arthur Miller, a american tragedy set in late 1940s brooykyln, depicting a Willy Loman, with the titular occupation, struggle as his world begins to fall apart. Miller represents the betrayal of the individuals by the American Dream, the separation of the Loman family, and the insanity that exacerbated this, in order to show the detrimental impact that American culture and society has on its individuals, and the people around them.

Miller was influenced by the Great Depression, and thus represents the modern capitalist society as one of falsity. The Wall Street Crash of 1929 had impacted the course of American History, catalysing the start of the Great Depression; during this time, the Miller family, who had been living comfortably until then, lost their financial stability and wealth.
