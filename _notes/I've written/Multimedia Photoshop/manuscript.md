## 11 - Raster

Raster graphics are a group of computer graphics that use pixels and a bitmap to display an image. Currently (2022), this is the most common form of computer graphics that appear on the internet, however, this is subject to change with the rise of vector graphics. 

Raster graphics are an adaptation of the technology used in televisions to display stuff, limited by the amount of pixels on a screen: the resolution. These graphics are great at displaying photographs and other non-line art images, as each pixel can be influenced separately from others, rather than having to rely on rudimentary shapes. However, higher resolutions come at the cost of requiring increasingly high storage. On top of that, scaled up images can lead to the appearance of a pixelated image.

There are many raster graphic file types, such as .png, .gif, and .jpeg. Most of these came as a result of trying to fix former file types.

## 11,a - Vector

Vector graphics are a group of images that are rendered through the use of mathematical formulae that define their shape. Due to this limitation, they often simply contain lines, curves, and other rudimentary shapes. These are the best for designs due to their similarity, however, is not as great for photographs and other complex images. These vector images are most commonly used for fonts and logos, as they can be scaled up without losing resolution, and they also take up less storage.

They are often in the .pdf or in .svg.

## Multimedia Planning

- Down the middle there will be a tear line. 
	- Use **clipping mask** for textures, add paper
	- Use **adjustment layers** to make it look right
	- Use **warp tool** to add some variety
- On the left (smaller) side, it will be illustrated. 
	- I think **size 3 pen** for outline will be good.
		- Doesn’t have to be straight
	- Try simplified colours to save time and to give it the stylised look. 
		- Make it look like an illustration
- On the right side, apply some filters and use adjustment layers.
	- Using **adjustment layers**, do the following:
		- Increase saturation and vibrancy
		- Change hues
- Make it look like it is half illustrated and half real

## Photoshop Evaluation

I believe that I did well during this course. Across the few weeks, I:

- Tuesday, Week 1: Made “Cheetos” (following an online resource) and experimented with adjustment layers
- Thursday, Week 1: Found an online course and followed it, making considerable progress (Untitled-1). Found how to use adjustment layers properly, use clipping masks, resize and crop images. (**I lost this progress**)
- Monday, Week 2: Continued to follow the tutorial, discovering test, and hue sliders.
- Tuesday, Week 2: Start work on Digital graphic. Applied different adjustment layers and made a rip texture. Started work outlining the surroundings and adding colours
- Thursday, Week 2: Did lots of work on Digital graphic, the illustration half is near completion.
- Tuesday, Week 3: Finished the Digital graphic. Yay :)

For my final digital graphic, I used many different tools, such as the warp tool, adjustment layers, and the tablet for illustrations. I believe that the rip and the illustration section of the graphic were the stronger suits, and that the real side was rather plain, although some people disagreed with my evaluation. I would’ve liked to have stumbled across one of the tutorials I used a lot, as I may have been able to learn more that way. Also, in hindsight, it might have been nice to seperate the colours between the sky and the water, and also add some clouds in the sky. Apart from that, I am happy with my image. Attached below is the original image and the digital graphic:
