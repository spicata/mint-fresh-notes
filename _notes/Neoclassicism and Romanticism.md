**Neoclassicism** happened when Europeans looked back at Ancient Greece and thought that it was cool. It favours a balance and order within its texts, creating a group of texts that followed structural guidelines. **Romanticism** is a rebellion from neoclassicism, which highly favours emotions and nature. It didnâ€™t quite completely break the structures of literature[^1], but when it limited the way that the author could express themselves, they ignored rules (see also [[Romanticism]]).
