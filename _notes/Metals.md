Metals are a type of material (see also: [[Materials]]). They rarely appear metallic in the natural world. Those that do are called native metals, such as gold. Otherwise, they are often found as ores. These are called minerals. Metals on their own are sure as hell useful, but they can become even more useful when they are alloyed. An alloy is a (metallic) mixture of two or more metals[^1] (see also: [[Mixtures]]). 

[^1]: And sometimes non-metals too. Steel is a perfect example of this. Steel is an alloy of iron and carbon. And it is extremely useful.
