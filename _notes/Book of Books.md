- We shared romanticism notes.
- Movements are an indication in the shift of attitude of the public. Most reactions come about from "status quo >:-("
- We analysed *[[London]]*

## 07th of February, 2023

- What is London about?
- Literature is all about readings. These are your own interpretations.
- Topic sentences should be topic-led.
    - How about instead of the TEEL structure, we use the PETAL structure (point, evidence, techniques, analysis, link).
- We wrote a short reading on London. And... uh... honestly I think I did pretty terrible. It was hot garbage. I don't have high expectations :-/.
- We also looked at Daffodils.
- Here are some poetic devices:
    - Enjambment, when we don't finish a line in a poem with a full stop. 
    - Caesura, when we break a line in the middle with a break (- or : or .)
- Enjambment and caesura can work together for even more emphasis.
- Romanticism is also kind of about exploration of self.
