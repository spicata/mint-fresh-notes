Life is a mix of luck and a mix of hard work. That’s the hard truth. Even if you are lucky, you need work. And sadder, even if you work hard, you need to be lucky. 

But if we realise we need luck, people tend to put in less effort, because they think it is futile. So pretend that all you need is hard work to succeed. Go in blind to the nature of reality. And if you ever emerge from it successfully, look back, think “how the hell did I survive”, and remember that luck played a part in that.
