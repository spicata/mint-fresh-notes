Being able to empathise is an essential part of coming to settlement. Try to walk a 1.6 kilometres in the other’s shoes[^1]. Try to understand the situation from our opponent’s perspective (see also, [[Treating Humans]]). And try even if it goes against your own perspective.

If you are that kind of person, you can do this to better understand them in order to find a way to abuse them further. Hopefully you’re not. This’ll help you understand them, so that you can reach a conclusion.

[^1]: Now you have a slightly-used pair of shoes.
