A world rife with war,  
Of bloodshed and of pain.  
Where the good go to die,  
The cruel survive.

A realm of deceit,  
Where loyalty crumbles.  
Everyone acts self-servingly,  
All else suffers.

A time of ignorance,  
Blunt dullness and apathy.  
Where laziness reigns,  
And humanity stagnates.

These universes,  
However terrible,  
Pale in comparison,  
To the universe where we never learn.
