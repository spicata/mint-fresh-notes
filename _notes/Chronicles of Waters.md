- We talked about some "important" stuff.
- Graphing is weighted a lot. It's also a pain in the neck, and bio is cringe.
- Bad graphs, and big graph no-no's:
    - Doesn't need to go through origin
    - Don't extrapolate data
    - Don't use points to calculate gradient.
- We live in a physical world.
- Distracted study is worse than no study. Do not use your phone when studying. Turn off notifications or put it in a different room. "I hate calls >:-("
- Physics is the easiest science. It's literally just addition, subtraction, multiplication, and the other one. And it's all on the formula sheet anyways.
- Rote memorisation is okay to do. We rote memorised the alphabet after all.
- If you are sick, please don't come to school. I don't want whatever you have. Covid exists. Also, "something something 'pond scum' something"
- Just try your best
