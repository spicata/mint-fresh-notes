- We talked about some "important" stuff.
- Graphing is weighted a lot. It's also a pain in the neck, and bio is cringe.
- Bad graphs, and big graph no-no's:
    - Doesn't need to go through origin
    - Don't extrapolate data
    - Don't use points to calculate gradient.
- We live in a physical world.
- Distracted study is worse than no study. Do not use your phone when studying. Turn off notifications or put it in a different room. "I hate calls >:-("
- Physics is the easiest science. It's literally just addition, subtraction, multiplication, and the other one. And it's all on the formula sheet anyways.
- Rote memorisation is okay to do. We rote memorised the alphabet after all.
- If you are sick, please don't come to school. I don't want whatever you have. Covid exists. Also, "something something 'pond scum' something"
- Just try your best

- Went over daily notices. Check them if you want. Or not if you don't.
- Covid is still going around. Enjoy life while you can. Try not to die.
- He shaved his beard (not in class but ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯).
- We looked at [[Error]] and uncertainty. Why? Well real-life measurements can never be completely true. Even if we got an extremely accurate ruler, atoms will always jiggle around, so good luck actually getting the "true" value.
    - Most of the time, this is good enough. If we're going to be realistic, "close enough" is good most of the time.
- This stuff is apparently worth a lot of marks over time.
    - Once Year 12 got bozo'd by an ENU[^1] question
    - This is cause WACE can just give what is essentially an extension question in the exams :-).
    - Also, ENU is the only thing not on the formula sheet, so learn this crap.
- Mentioned absolute vs percentage errors.
- Only time we can remove measurement error is with an absolute zero ruler.
    - Although, this effect is negligible
- [[Four Measures of Correctness]] is actually pain. But we need this cause science in empirical... sometimes.
    - Even 9.80m/s/s for gravity was figured out empirically. 
- Something about fungus gene knockout that took 123 tries and researchers giving each other kisses. Also amino acids.
- Something about *Breaking Bad* and volumetric glass, and something about Waters' son wanting to do a Mista White.
- As long as the true values fall within your error range, that experiment is accurate. If it doesn't, then it is inaccurate.
- ChatGPT is unreliable, but can give you hints I guess. Waters is hopeful for the future; maybe ChatGPT can become like Wikipedia.
