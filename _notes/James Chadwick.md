Chadwick in 1932 discovered the neutron. He based his research off of Rutherford's work in 1920, when he found the proton. This was due to a discrepancy between the mass of the nucleus and the mass of the protons. Chadwick theorised the existence of a neutrally-charged particle that is similar in mass to a proton.
