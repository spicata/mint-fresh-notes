For you opponents, and your friends… break their fall. Nobody wants to get their reputation tarnished (see also [[Acting in Fear]]). By preserving their public image, you can get them to agree (or whatever you are doing) with the conclusion.

Good judges don’t say that Team A was considerably better than Team B, and that Team B is a boson. Good judges say it was a close game. They break the fall of Team B, so that no bitter feelings continue to linger.
