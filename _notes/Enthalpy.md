I remember hating enthalpy. Why? No clue.

Enthalpy is the [[Amount]] of energy in a system. What's a system? Literally anything. An ice cube can be a "system". Any object can be a system. Everything else is surroundings.

Exothermic reactions release energy. Enthalpy is going down. Endothermic reactions absorb energy. Enthalpy increases.
