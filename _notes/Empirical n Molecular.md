The empirical formula is the formula of a molecule simplified. It uses the simplest ratio it can (see [[Stoichiometry]]). On the other hand, we have molecular formula, which is the true formula. Itâ€™s easier to show with an example.

The empirical formula for ethane is $CH_{3}$. The molecular formula is $C_{2}H_{6}$.
