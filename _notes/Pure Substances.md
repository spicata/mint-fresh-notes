Pure means that a substance has a constant composition and a fixed properties. It is divided into elements and compounds. Elements are just the elements on the periodic table[^1]. Compounds are made up elements, and they have a fixed atomic ratio. For example, table saltâ€™s chemical compound[^2] is NaCl, meaning that it always has one sodium atom for each one chlorine atom.

Compounds can be organic or not that[^3]. Organic compounds are compounds containing carbon that is produced by organisms. Inorganic compounds are not produced by organisms. It often has a metal and a non-metal. For example, NaCl is an inorganic compounds. Metal is always first.[^4] It can also have polyatomic ions.

[^1]: Pretty self-explanatory I would hope.
[^2]: If it was completely uncontaminated
[^3]: Inorganic, but I just wanted to emphasise it :*)*
[^4]: Sodium Chloride in this example.
