Habits are funny. Overtime, they become “invisible”, because they become so ingrained into our behaviour. Especially for bad habits, its good that we bring attention to them, so that we can try to fix them. A good thing to do is to call yourself out every time you do the habit. Other times, we don’t know the cues that cause our habits ([[Habitual Cues]], [[Habit Anatomy]]). So, we need to figure it out. Good luck! :*)*
