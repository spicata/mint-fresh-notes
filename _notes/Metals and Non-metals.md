Metals have distinctive physical properties (see also: [[Metals]]). Firstly, they are lustrous when polished. Secondly, they are both good heat and electric conductors. Their electrical conductivity is due to the mobile electrons within metal crystals. Thirdly, they are malleable[^1] and also ductile[^2]. They are all solid, except mercury, because mercury.

Non-metals can be solid, liquid, or gas. Solid non-metals tend to be dull and brittle. They also are not good electric or heat conductors[^3]. There are also semi-metals[^4], which are a sort of intermediate element between metals and non-metals.
