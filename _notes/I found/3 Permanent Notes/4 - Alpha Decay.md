# 4 - Alpha Decay

Radioactive decay is the process that atoms undergo to become more stable by releasing energy or particles ([[4,4a - After Decay (P)]], [[8 - How a Nuclear Reactor Works]]). A type of this is alpha decay, which releases alpha particles ([[4,a - Why does it release alpha particles]]) ($\alpha$ particles), which is identical to a helium nucleus ([[4,5a - The Helium Nucleus]]) (two protons and two neutrons.)

Alpha decay is extremely slow, short-reaching, and not penetrative ([[4,3a - Why larger particles are less penetrative (P)]]), which means that alpha-emitters are relatively safe, and able to be stopped by a sheet of paper. However, it is extremely ionising due to its mass, meaning that it can wreak havoc on cells when it comes into close contact with them ([[4,6a - Harms of Ionising Radiation]]).
