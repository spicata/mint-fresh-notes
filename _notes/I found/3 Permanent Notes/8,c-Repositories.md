# 8,c - Repositories #Permanent 
By far the best way of disposing nuclear waste, both in the present and in the future, would be to store it deep underground until it decays enough to not be radioactive. These facilities are known as repositories, and are currently being used to store nuclear waste. 

Several countries already have these repositories, while others are still undergoing the construction of them. Currently, large repositories are being built in both Sweden and Finland. Despite how undesirable these storage systems may seem, they are relatively safe, and there are no other great alternatives (yet) to storing nuclear waste.

For liquid nuclear waste, it is more difficult to store permanently in these repositories, as all the containers we are capable of building with eventually break during the thousands of years that these materials need to decay. As a result, liquid nuclear waste is currently vitrified into glass, however, there is uncertainty to how long nuclear glass can remain.
