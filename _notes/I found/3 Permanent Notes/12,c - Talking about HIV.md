# 12,c - Talking about HIV

HIV, being an extremely stigmatised topic, can often be difficult to talk about, thus this is important to take into consideration when talking about HIV. If you are the person listening, do not stigmatise or ostracises them. It is often this stigma that makes talking about HIV so difficult, so do not propagate that cycle. On top of that, be respectfully, listen, and do not be disingenuous; they probably chose you to talk to as they trust you. Finally, when you can, try to learn more about HIV.

If you are the person talking, first talk to your family and friends that you trust. Try to be direct, but take you time, and be clear about what you want to say. You will also need to inform your sexual and needle-sharing partners. You can choose to do this with a help of a counsellor, or if you want, a health professional can inform them anonymously.
