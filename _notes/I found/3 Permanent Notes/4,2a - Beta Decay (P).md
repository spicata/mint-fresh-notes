# 4,2a - Beta Decay 
Beta decay is another way that unstable nuclei can achieve stability ([4,2a,a - Beta or Alpha decay](4,2a,a%20-%20Beta%20or%20Alpha%20decay.md)md)md)). It occurs when neutrons transform into a proton (positron) and a electron (negat[4,2b - Beta Decay Unlimited (P)](4,2b%20-%20Beta%20Decay%20Unlimited%20(P).md)P).md)P))), increasing stability by increasing the proton to neutron ratio. The electron is tiny, and so it can be ejected from the nucleus as an incredibly high speed[^1]. This is the $\beta$ particle.

Beta decay has higher penetration, as the smaller particle allows it to fit through more gaps in a surface than the $\alpha$ particle. However, it has a lower ionisation ability as it needs to not only be closer due its size, but also because it has a weaker charge.

It often appears with gamma[4,2a,2a - Gamma Decay](4,2a,2a%20-%20Gamma%20Decay.md)Decay.md)Decay)).

[^1]: As the amount of protons in a nuclei increases, does the “ejection speed” also increase?
