- *The Communist Manifesto* cannot be boiled down into philosophy. Rather, a critique of philosophy. However, instead of discrediting it, it rather reinforced it by advocating how philosophy should be put into reality over simply thoughts.
- Marx would consider each aspect of human nature in relation to each other rather than using abstractions.
- Paradoxically, the more output the worker has to produce, he grows more impoverished, as the output is not his to have under the capitalist system, rather feeding the bourgeoise. This alienates the worker from his worker.
- Humans inherently creative and productive beings, however, the capitalist system uses this fact to their benefit.
- Humanity produces more than what is needed to sustain themselves. Where does the rest go?
	- This harms both the environment and people, only to support the economy.
- Inevitability a revolution by proletariats, either violent or a “permanent” one, where a secondary government by the proletariats are formed.
