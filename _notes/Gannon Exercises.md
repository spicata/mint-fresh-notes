- We started combinatorics: combinations and permutations. They are essentially the same thing, but we divide combinations by "r!", which are the different ways of organising it.
- Mentioned complementary events, but didn't go into depth.
- He also talked about "2 to the power of n", which is the total amount of combination possible (possible). 
    - For example, there are 7 people you want to invite to your birthday. The first person could either come or not. Ditto for second. Repeat that. In total, you have 2 to the power of 7 possibilities.
