Ionic crystals are brittle (and hard). Covalent molecular crystals are brittle (somehow soft). Covalent network crystals are brittle (very hard). We live in a brittle world. Don’t trip, you might break the floor…

Although, there are also metals, which are pretty ductile and malleable, so I mean, it’s got that going for it (see also [[Metals and Non-metals]]).
