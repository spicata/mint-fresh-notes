The word [[Romanticism]] is uh... pretty vague. It's use started in Germany, and then spread the France, England, Italy, Spain, the Slavic states. As it spread, it was used in [[Romanticism vs Classicism]]. With this, it became extremely vague. What does it mean to be Romantic? This is a common complaint.
