How will you know what others want, need, think, or feel if you don’t ask them? So ask. It’s not much I ask you to do. To add to that, asking around gets people to participate in solving the problem, and they feel as if the solution is at least partly done by them. And humans get stuff tangled in their ego (see also [[Stances and Ego]]), meaning that they’ll defend the solution if it comes to that.

To add to that, give the stakeholders the means to change. Don’t spearhead the movement yourself. You don’t know what is best for them. They do.
