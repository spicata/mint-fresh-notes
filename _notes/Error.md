There are three types of errors: measurement error, systematic error, and random error. Measurement error is inevitable. As no measurement is completely accurate, that means we have to live with good enough. This leads to measurement error. The amount is variable, it depends on what we are measuring and what we measure with.

Systematic error is errors that happen because of how we run the experiment. They change results by the same amount in the same direction. This shifts the overall result, lessening the accuracy but keeping the precision roughly similar.

Random error happens randomly, and it changes the result randomly too. This changes the precision of the experiment, but keeps accuracy roughly the same, because the average should stay roughly the same.
