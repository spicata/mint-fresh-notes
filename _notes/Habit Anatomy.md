Cue, craving, action, reward is the breakdown of habits. Firstly, there is something that prompts us to do the habit. Then, we begin to crave the reward, which acts as a motivation to do the action ([[Habits and Loss Aversion]]). The action helps us get the reward (usually satisfying the craving is enough).

Every time the process is taken, it reinforces this cycle, and cues become linked with the habit, so that every time the cue appears, we start to crave the habit. However, knowing this, we can arm ourselves to kill the habit. Remove the cue, reduce the craving, make the action difficult, or reduce the reward. Do some of these, and you won’t do your habit. Do all, and you won’t repeat it.
