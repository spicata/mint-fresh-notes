Please remember that a literary critic is not someone who goes around and says "this is crap". Literary critics are people who interprets texts. Everyone carries their own [[Literary Theory]]s, but some groups tend to have similar ideas. People who think in the equality for women are called feminist, those who support Marx are called Marxists. It's pretty arbitrary, but eh.
