Honestly, I think we humans are experts at missing the point. 

Each law has a general idea or point that it is referring to, and yet people take cases where the argue the wording.

Each measurement has a purpose of being measured — a general thing that it hopes to achieve — and yet people wish to increase the measurement itself.

Each argument has a broad topic that it addresses, but people take it out of context and mangle the words.

In general, we are just very good at missing the point. Usually to our detriment.
