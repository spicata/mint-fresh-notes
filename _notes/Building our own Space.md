We[^1] are making our own corner of the internet, much like how [Jacky Zhao](https://jzhao.xyz), [Nicole Seah](https://nicoles.substack.com/), [Nadia Asparouhova](https://nadia.xyz/), [Nicky Case](https://ncase.me/), and others have done[^2]. Hopefully, it grows into something of actual use, but for now, we’re just having some fun. It’s our passion project ([[Passion Projects]]).

[^2]: Upmost respect for those people by the way.
