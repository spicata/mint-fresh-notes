- Today was a very content heavy lesson.

    - I'll run through it briefly. Some ancient Greeks guessed that there are indivisible particles that make everything. They called this the atomos.
    - [[John Dalton]] found the atom.
    - [[JJ Thomson]] found the electron.
    - [[Ernest Rutherford]] found the nucleus and the proton.
    - [[Niels Bohr]] made the planetary model.
    - Heisenberg made the quantum model, which is based on probability.
- Modern science, unlike ancient philosophy, has the special quality of standing on the shoulders of giants.
- Atoms are "the basic building blocks of matter"
- We looked at [[Atomic Forces]].
- Why don't electrons suicide into the nucleus? Well some funky quantum stuff.
