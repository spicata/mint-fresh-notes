Texts are funny. We are able to all read the same thing, but get different meanings. The obvious one is the literal meaning. *1984* is literally just about a guy in an authoritarian country[^1]. There is also the inferred meaning. It is about the way that governments influence us[^2]. **Inferred** meaning relies heavily on symbolism, such as connotations and others.

[^1]: Or something like that, I haven’t read it.
[^2]: I still think. Again, I haven’t read it.
