## Method

Materials:

- 1x Stopwatch
- 6x 50g Slotted masses
- 1x Mass hanger
- 1x Pulley and clamp
- 1x Roll of string
- 1x Dynamics trolley
- 1x Long wooden track

Method:

1. Clamp pulley onto the end of the wooden track, and place onto the table, ensuring that the side with the pulley stays slightly off the table.
2. Place the dynamics trolley on the track facing towards the pulley.
3. Wrap a string around the front of the dynamics trolley, and wrap the other end of the string on the mass hanger. Ensure that the string is long enough that the mass hanger can reach the ground when the dynamics trolley is close to the trolley.
4. Place the string over the pulley.
5. Mark the position where the start of the trolley is on the track when the mass hanger is almost touching the trolley (A).
6. Mark the position where the start of the trolley is when the mass hanger is almost touching the floor (B).
7. Measure the distance between A and B.
8. Place six 50g masses on the dynamics trolley.
9. Starting at point A, gently let go of the trolley and measure the time it takes to reach point B. The observer should be stay in front of the ending point.
10. Repeat step 9 three more times.
12. Repeat steps 9 and 10, moving a mass from the trolley onto the mass hanger until you can move no more.
13. Calculate the acceleration using the time measured, the distance between the two positions and the motion equations. Calculate the force using the second law of motion.
