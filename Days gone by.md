I remember the days of biting cold air,  
Where the ground was still soft.  
We would smile and play  
Without a care in the world.

I remember the days of warm summer rays,  
You two would argue and fight  
And us caught between  
Picked sides.

I remember the days when time held still.  
We thought we were invincible  
And dreamt of power  
As we looked for the end.

I wonâ€™t mourn  
Those days gone by  
But [[Rejoice|rejoice]].
