Today, I took the wrong turn. I walked down the wrong path, and crossed the wrong roads. Found myself in a n unfamiliar part of the sprawling metropholis I call home. Similar looking different roads. I simply wandered, knowign that I coul dalways use my phone to lead my back, but I had no need; there was no rush today, nothing I had to complete. The grey concrete slabs stretched to the horizon, forming a path, whcih interlocked with each other to gcreate suburbs, altogether froming a city. Thsi path looked different somehow, maybe a bit more worn out, possibily a slightly different shade of grey. or it might have been the way my shoes tapped on it.

As I walked, a patch of emerald green amongst the greys an d blues caught my eyes. A park thriving amongst giants. Magnificnet tree s and verdent grass encapsulated int a little bubble of the city, hidden by massive concrete buildings; not that anyone has time to look aounr d anymore. Had it been completelt exposed, epople would have still not noticeds. Enamoured bi it, I walk towards the park. 

A small buzz, then silence. i check my phone, now Totally lost. I look around. The unfamiliarity of the surroundings confuse me. In a moment of panic, I disorient myself. Where had I come from?
