We live in a pretty imperfect world; some could even say it's broken. To be frank, they're kind of right. Earth in 2023 is filled with chaos, inequality and distrust. Who could forget to mention the dictators[^1] and their violation of basic human rights[^2]? Ah, and how about the climate disaster[^3] and the breakdown of democratic processes[^4]? And the massive corporations concerned with keeping a profit than the safety of the consumers and employees[^5]. As well as the increases in suicide and mental illnesses such as depression and anxiety[^6]? The destruction of culture and history[^7]? The commercialisation of the internet and the elimination of our influence on it? The state of Africa[^8]? The good seems to go bad, and the bad gets worse. Hm :-/...

So, the question I ask you is... can we make our world better? Obviously, I don't know the answer. Who the hell do you think I am? But, I think that trying to fix it is worth a try. We should try to figure out how to fix at least a tiny problem that exists in the world. 7 billion each solving one little problem they care about? That would be cool ðŸ˜Ž.
