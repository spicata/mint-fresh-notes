New Year’s resolutions are a pretty common thing during New Year, but another common thing is never being able to complete these goals. And so, maybe we should try to do it differently.

## A Defence of New Year’s Resolutions 

New Year’s resolutions are so “enticing” because it happens on the **first** day of the year. And humans like this idea of starting a new thing — whether it be a goal, a habit, a new behaviour — at the start of something. Changes usually happen at the start of the week, at the start of the month, at the start of a new year.

And in principle, creating a goal for yourself is a great idea! You have a direction to aim towards for the year. But then why is it that these goals never go finished? Why is it that New Year’s resolutions are seen as just something will just lead to failure?


## The Problem?

I think that this problem boils down to two big points. Firstly, we set ourselves up to fail. Secondly, the motivation we get from a new year runs dry incredibly quickly.

### Setting Ourselves up to Fail 

Goals are indeed useful for deciding where we want to go. In which direction we want to steer our ship in the currents of life. But outside that, they aren’t that necessary. All we do by continuously focusing on our goals is that we sort of emphasise that we aren’t there yet.

We also tend to overestimate our own abilities, and so we set some really lofty, unreachable goals. And if we fail at our goal? Well… everyone’s responses are different. But generally, you probably feel unfulfilled.

### New Year’s Motivation 

A new year in our hands; a new start. “Things will be different this year.” We seem to get this massive surge of enthusiasm, we think we can take on the world. This motivation runs dry **very** quickly.

This is the Google Trends for the word “resolution”. Most of the peaks lie at December or January. After that is a steep drop off in February. We set it, can’t be bothered to do it, and forget it.

## A Solution?

I believe there are some easy ways to tackle these previous points about the problems with resolutions.

### Focus on the Method 

Instead of focusing on the goal, you focus on how you will get there. Instead of saying “I want to lose 10 kilograms” or “I want to achieve perfect marks”, how about “I will try to live a more healthy life” and “I will work hard and hone my skills”.

We could also be more specific. “I will try to exercise 5 times a week” or “I will spend 30 minutes a day studying this one subject”. If we try to focus on the method, we have something more tangible to work with than a goal. This alone, however, won’t do the trick. We also need to…

### Have Little Victories 

Set your goals low. Insulting low. So low that it is almost impossible to fail at it. “I will do 2 minutes of exercise a day”. “I will read 3 pages a day”. These goals, no matter how little you do, you’ll probably struggle in failing them. Your goals should just be that easy.

Continuing doing this, and eventually, you might think: “What the hell. If I can do this, I can also do that.” Now you find yourself exercising for 5 minutes a day. Eventually 10. At some point, you might do 20 minutes.

This is the beauty with little victories. They are so easy you can’t fail them, but they still give you the satisfaction of having done your goal. And eventually, you can increase the amount of work you do.

## Conclusion 

Having New Year’s resolutions is not a bad thing. You just need to be smart about it. You should try to…

1. focus on how you will achieve your goals (be specific about it), and
1. set yourself goals that you literally cannot fail.

Hopefully, this’ll do you good.
