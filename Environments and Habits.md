Environments and contexts are important for habits, as they are where we do stuff. They also act as cues, and so it is important to deliberately place cues in different places ([[Obvious Cues]]). Your bed should be a cue for sleeping, and sleeping only. Not for reading books, and not for watching your phone. That way, you associate bed with reading. Do that for everything. Desk is for study, chair is for reading. Split up your environments.

Imagine if CGP Grey made a video covering this idea. Oh, wait.
