Atoms bond to each other. Pretty simple, leads to complex results. Ionic and covalent bonds are quite strong.[^1] Covalent bonds are measured in bonding energy[^2], the energy needed to break apart a covalent bond. To make them stop sharing. Itâ€™s roughly equivalent to what binding energy does in nuclear physics ([[4,5b - Binding Energy and Mass Defect]] (It is an outdated note) ). Ionic bonds are measured in lattice energy, the energy needed to force ions to disassociate.
