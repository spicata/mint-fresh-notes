English Romanticism was pretty big. It started with the Lake Poets: Wordsworth, Coleridge, and Southey. They are called this because they lived near a lake (i presume). They were pretty big. Then we had the Scott Group, with... Scott. It also had (Thomas) Campbell and (Thomas) Moore. Finally, we had the Younger Group, with all of the late-romantic poets, such as Byron, Shelly, and Keats. They would suffer a bit more than the other ones.
