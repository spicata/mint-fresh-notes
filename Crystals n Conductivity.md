Crystals are cool, but most of them aren’t conductive. Solid ionic crystals (see [[Crystals n Ionic Ones]]) are not conductive. And that makes logical sense. They are bond together by charge. If the charge moves around, then they would not be solid. So a solid ionic crystal doesn’t conduct electricity. However, when it is melted down or dissolved in water, then they are now free to move around, so they can conduct electricity.

Covalent molecular structures and covalent networks structures usually don’t conduct. Except again, graphite. So yeah.

Also, there are metals. Metals conduct very well. Both heat and electricity, cause of their sea of electrons (see also [[Metals and Non-metals]]).
