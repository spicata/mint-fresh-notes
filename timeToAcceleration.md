you measured the time it took for the trolley to move. but how do we turn that into acceleration? well it's pretty easy.

first you want to apply the motion equations. specifically the "s = ut + 0.5at^2". we can rearrange this to get a = (s + ut) / (0.5t^2).

as we measured time, we just substitute that it. the initial velocity is obviously 0 (unless you botched your experiment). and s is just the distance that the trolley measured. for us, it was 0.69 metres but for you it might be different. sub all that in and you get acceleration (in m per s per s).

now we need to get the error of the measurements. so you just get to percentage uncertainty of s and t. then you add the them (s + t + t because t is squared).

*fin*.
